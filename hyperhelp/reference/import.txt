*|index-0:⚓|*

Python code in one |:glossary.txt/term-module:module| gains access to the code in another module by the
process of |:glossary.txt/term-importing:importing| it.  The |:reference/simple_stmts.txt/import:import| statement is the most common way of
invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way.  Functions such as
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.import_module:importlib.import_module()| and built-in |:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| can also be used to
invoke the import machinery.

The |:reference/simple_stmts.txt/import:import| statement combines two operations; it searches for the named
module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope.
The search operation of the "import" statement is defined as a call to the
|:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of
|:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| is used to perform the name binding operation of the "import"
statement.  See the "import" statement for the exact details of that name
binding operation.

A direct call to |:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| performs only the module search and, if found,
the module creation operation.  While certain side-effects may occur, such as
the importing of parent packages, and the updating of various caches (including
|:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|), only the |:reference/simple_stmts.txt/import:import| statement performs a name binding operation.

When an |:reference/simple_stmts.txt/import:import| statement is executed, the standard builtin |:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()|
function is called. Other mechanisms for invoking the import system (such as
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.import_module:importlib.import_module()|) may choose to bypass |:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| and use their
own solutions to implement import semantics.

When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if found, it
creates a module object [1], initializing it.  If the named module cannot be
found, a |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError| is raised.  Python implements various strategies
to search for the named module when the import machinery is invoked.  These
strategies can be modified and extended by using various hooks described in the
sections below.

Changed in version 3.3: The import system has been updated to fully implement
the second phase of *|index-1:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302:PEP 302|. There is no longer any implicit
import machinery - the full import system is exposed through |:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path|. In
addition, native namespace package support has been implemented (see
*|index-2:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420|).

# importlib:|:library/importlib.txt/module-importlib:importlib|

The |:library/importlib.txt/module-importlib:importlib| module provides a rich API for interacting with the import
system.  For example |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.import_module:importlib.import_module()| provides a recommended, simpler
API than built-in |:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| for invoking the import machinery.  Refer to
the |:library/importlib.txt/module-importlib:importlib| library documentation for additional detail.

# packages:Packages*|index-3:⚓|*

Python has only one type of module object, and all modules are of this type,
regardless of whether the module is implemented in Python, C, or something else.
To help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy, Python has a concept of
|:glossary.txt/term-package:packages|.

You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as
files within directories, but don’t take this analogy too literally since
packages and modules need not originate from the file system.  For the purposes
of this documentation, we’ll use this convenient analogy of directories and
files.  Like file system directories, packages are organized hierarchically, and
packages may themselves contain subpackages, as well as regular modules.

It’s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all
modules are packages.  Or put another way, packages are just a special kind of
module.  Specifically, any module that contains a "__path__" attribute is
considered a package.

All modules have a name.  Subpackage names are separated from their parent
package name by dots, akin to Python’s standard attribute access syntax.  Thus
you might have a module called |:library/sys.txt/module-sys:sys| and a package called |:library/email.txt/module-email:email|, which in turn
has a subpackage called |:library/email.mime.txt/module-email.mime:email.mime| and a module within that subpackage called
"email.mime.text".

## regular-packages:Regular packages*|index-4:⚓|*

Python defines two types of packages, |:glossary.txt/term-regular-package:regular packages| and
|:glossary.txt/term-namespace-package:namespace packages|.  Regular packages are traditional packages as they existed
in Python 3.2 and earlier. A regular package is typically implemented as a
directory containing an "__init__.py" file.  When a regular package is imported,
this "__init__.py" file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are
bound to names in the package’s namespace.  The "__init__.py" file can contain
the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some
additional attributes to the module when it is imported.

For example, the following file system layout defines a top level "parent"
package with three subpackages:

```rst
parent/
    __init__.py
    one/
        __init__.py
    two/
        __init__.py
    three/
        __init__.py
```

Importing "parent.one" will implicitly execute "parent/__init__.py" and "
parent/one/__init__.py".  Subsequent imports of "parent.two" or "parent.three"
will execute "parent/two/__init__.py" and "parent/three/__init__.py"
respectively.

## namespace-packages:Namespace packages*|index-5:⚓|*

A namespace package is a composite of various |:glossary.txt/term-portion:portions|, where each portion
contributes a subpackage to the parent package.  Portions may reside in
different locations on the file system.  Portions may also be found in zip
files, on the network, or anywhere else that Python searches during import.
Namespace packages may or may not correspond directly to objects on the file
system; they may be virtual modules that have no concrete representation.

Namespace packages do not use an ordinary list for their "__path__" attribute.
They instead use a custom iterable type which will automatically perform a new
search for package portions on the next import attempt within that package if
the path of their parent package (or |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| for a top level package)
changes.

With namespace packages, there is no "parent/__init__.py" file.  In fact, there
may be multiple "parent" directories found during import search, where each one
is provided by a different portion.  Thus "parent/one" may not be physically
located next to "parent/two".  In this case, Python will create a namespace
package for the top-level "parent" package whenever it or one of its subpackages
is imported.

See also *|index-6:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420| for the namespace package specification.

# searching:Searching

To begin the search, Python needs the |:glossary.txt/term-qualified-name:fully qualified| name of the module (or
package, but for the purposes of this discussion, the difference is immaterial)
being imported.  This name may come from various arguments to the |:reference/simple_stmts.txt/import:import|
statement, or from the parameters to the |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.import_module:importlib.import_module()| or
|:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| functions.

This name will be used in various phases of the import search, and it may be the
dotted path to a submodule, e.g. "foo.bar.baz".  In this case, Python first
tries to import "foo", then "foo.bar", and finally "foo.bar.baz". If any of the
intermediate imports fail, a |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError| is raised.

## the-module-cache:The module cache*|index-7:⚓|*

The first place checked during import search is |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|.  This mapping
serves as a cache of all modules that have been previously imported, including
the intermediate paths.  So if "foo.bar.baz" was previously imported,
|:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| will contain entries for "foo", "foo.bar", and "foo.bar.baz".
Each key will have as its value the corresponding module object.

During import, the module name is looked up in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| and if present, the
associated value is the module satisfying the import, and the process completes.
However, if the value is "None", then a |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError| is raised.  If the
module name is missing, Python will continue searching for the module.

|:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| is writable.  Deleting a key may not destroy the associated module
(as other modules may hold references to it), but it will invalidate the cache
entry for the named module, causing Python to search anew for the named module
upon its next import. The key can also be assigned to "None", forcing the next
import of the module to result in a |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError|.

Beware though, as if you keep a reference to the module object, invalidate its
cache entry in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|, and then re-import the named module, the two
module objects will *not* be the same. By contrast, |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.reload:importlib.reload()| will
reuse the *same* module object, and simply reinitialise the module contents by
rerunning the module’s code.

*|finders-and-loaders:⚓|* ## finders-and-loaders:Finders and loaders
*|index-8:⚓|*

If the named module is not found in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|, then Python’s import protocol
is invoked to find and load the module.  This protocol consists of two
conceptual objects, |:glossary.txt/term-finder:finders| and |:glossary.txt/term-loader:loaders|. A finder’s job is to determine
whether it can find the named module using whatever strategy it knows about.
Objects that implement both of these interfaces are referred to as |:glossary.txt/term-importer:importers| -
they return themselves when they find that they can load the requested module.

Python includes a number of default finders and importers.  The first one knows
how to locate built-in modules, and the second knows how to locate frozen
modules.  A third default finder searches an |:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path| for modules.  The
|:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path| is a list of locations that may name file system paths or zip
files.  It can also be extended to search for any locatable resource, such as
those identified by URLs.

The import machinery is extensible, so new finders can be added to extend the
range and scope of module searching.

Finders do not actually load modules.  If they can find the named module, they
return a *module spec*, an encapsulation of the module’s import-related
information, which the import machinery then uses when loading the module.

The following sections describe the protocol for finders and loaders in more
detail, including how you can create and register new ones to extend the import
machinery.

Changed in version 3.4: In previous versions of Python, finders returned
|:glossary.txt/term-loader:loaders| directly, whereas now they return module specs which *contain*
loaders. Loaders are still used during import but have fewer responsibilities.

## import-hooks:Import hooks*|index-9:⚓|*

The import machinery is designed to be extensible; the primary mechanism for
this are the *import hooks*.  There are two types of import hooks: *meta hooks*
and *import path hooks*.

Meta hooks are called at the start of import processing, before any other import
processing has occurred, other than |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| cache look up. This allows
meta hooks to override |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| processing, frozen modules, or even built-in
modules.  Meta hooks are registered by adding new finder objects to
|:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path|, as described below.

Import path hooks are called as part of |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| (or "package.__path__")
processing, at the point where their associated path item is encountered.
Import path hooks are registered by adding new callables to |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_hooks:sys.path_hooks| as
described below.

## the-meta-path:The meta path*|index-10:⚓|*

When the named module is not found in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|, Python next searches
|:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path|, which contains a list of meta path finder objects.  These
finders are queried in order to see if they know how to handle the named module.
Meta path finders must implement a method called |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| which takes three
arguments: a name, an import path, and (optionally) a target module.  The meta
path finder can use any strategy it wants to determine whether it can handle the
named module or not.

If the meta path finder knows how to handle the named module, it returns a spec
object.  If it cannot handle the named module, it returns "None".  If
|:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path| processing reaches the end of its list without returning a spec,
then a |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError| is raised.  Any other exceptions raised are simply
propagated up, aborting the import process.

The |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| method of meta path finders is called with two or three
arguments.  The first is the fully qualified name of the module being imported,
for example "foo.bar.baz". The second argument is the path entries to use for
the module search.  For top-level modules, the second argument is "None", but
for submodules or subpackages, the second argument is the value of the parent
package’s "__path__" attribute. If the appropriate "__path__" attribute cannot
be accessed, a |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError| is raised.  The third argument is an
existing module object that will be the target of loading later. The import
system passes in a target module only during reload.

The meta path may be traversed multiple times for a single import request. For
example, assuming none of the modules involved has already been cached,
importing "foo.bar.baz" will first perform a top level import, calling "
mpf.find_spec("foo", None, None)" on each meta path finder ("mpf"). After "foo"
has been imported, "foo.bar" will be imported by traversing the meta path a
second time, calling "mpf.find_spec("foo.bar", foo.__path__, None)". Once "
foo.bar" has been imported, the final traversal will call "
mpf.find_spec("foo.bar.baz", foo.bar.__path__, None)".

Some meta path finders only support top level imports. These importers will
always return "None" when anything other than "None" is passed as the second
argument.

Python’s default |:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path| has three meta path finders, one that knows how
to import built-in modules, one that knows how to import frozen modules, and one
that knows how to import modules from an |:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path| (i.e. the
|:glossary.txt/term-path-based-finder:path based finder|).

Changed in version 3.4: The |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| method of meta path finders replaced
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_module:find_module()|, which is now deprecated.  While it will continue to work
without change, the import machinery will try it only if the finder does not
implement "find_spec()".

# loading:Loading

If and when a module spec is found, the import machinery will use it (and the
loader it contains) when loading the module.  Here is an approximation of what
happens during the loading portion of import:

```rst
module = None
if spec.loader is not None and hasattr(spec.loader, 'create_module'):
    # It is assumed 'exec_module' will also be defined on the loader.
    module = spec.loader.create_module(spec)
if module is None:
    module = ModuleType(spec.name)
# The import-related module attributes get set here:
_init_module_attrs(spec, module)

if spec.loader is None:
    # unsupported
    raise ImportError
if spec.origin is None and spec.submodule_search_locations is not None:
    # namespace package
    sys.modules[spec.name] = module
elif not hasattr(spec.loader, 'exec_module'):
    module = spec.loader.load_module(spec.name)
    # Set __loader__ and __package__ if missing.
else:
    sys.modules[spec.name] = module
    try:
        spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    except BaseException:
        try:
            del sys.modules[spec.name]
        except KeyError:
            pass
        raise
return sys.modules[spec.name]
```

Note the following details:

   * If there is an existing module object with the given name in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|,
     import will have already returned it.

   * The module will exist in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| before the loader executes the module
     code.  This is crucial because the module code may (directly or indirectly)
     import itself; adding it to |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| beforehand prevents unbounded
     recursion in the worst case and multiple loading in the best.

   * If loading fails, the failing module – and only the failing module – gets
     removed from |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|.  Any module already in the |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| cache, and
     any module that was successfully loaded as a side-effect, must remain in the
     cache.  This contrasts with reloading where even the failing module is left in
     |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|.

   * After the module is created but before execution, the import machinery sets the
     import-related module attributes (“_init_module_attrs” in the pseudo-code
     example above), as summarized in a |:import-mod-attrs:later section|.

   * Module execution is the key moment of loading in which the module’s namespace
     gets populated.  Execution is entirely delegated to the loader, which gets to
     decide what gets populated and how.

   * The module created during loading and passed to exec_module() may not be the one
     returned at the end of import [2].

Changed in version 3.4: The import system has taken over the boilerplate
responsibilities of loaders.  These were previously performed by the
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.load_module:importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()| method.

## loaders:Loaders

Module loaders provide the critical function of loading: module execution. The
import machinery calls the |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module:importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module()| method with a
single argument, the module object to execute.  Any value returned from
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module:exec_module()| is ignored.

Loaders must satisfy the following requirements:

   * If the module is a Python module (as opposed to a built-in module or a
     dynamically loaded extension), the loader should execute the module’s code in
     the module’s global name space ("module.__dict__").

   * If the loader cannot execute the module, it should raise an |:library/exceptions.txt/ImportError:ImportError|,
     although any other exception raised during |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module:exec_module()| will be propagated.

In many cases, the finder and loader can be the same object; in such cases the
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| method would just return a spec with the loader set to "self".

Module loaders may opt in to creating the module object during loading by
implementing a |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.create_module:create_module()| method. It takes one argument, the module spec,
and returns the new module object to use during loading.  "create_module()" does
not need to set any attributes on the module object.  If the method returns "
None", the import machinery will create the new module itself.

New in version 3.4: The |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.create_module:create_module()| method of loaders.

Changed in version 3.4: The |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.load_module:load_module()| method was replaced by
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module:exec_module()| and the import machinery assumed all the boilerplate
responsibilities of loading.For compatibility with existing loaders, the import
machinery will use the "load_module()" method of loaders if it exists and the
loader does not also implement "exec_module()".  However, "load_module()" has
been deprecated and loaders should implement "exec_module()" instead.The "
load_module()" method must implement all the boilerplate loading functionality
described above in addition to executing the module.  All the same constraints
apply, with some additional clarification:

   * If there is an existing module object with the given name in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|, the
     loader must use that existing module. (Otherwise, |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.reload:importlib.reload()| will not
     work correctly.)  If the named module does not exist in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|, the
     loader must create a new module object and add it to |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|.

   * The module *must* exist in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules| before the loader executes the module
     code, to prevent unbounded recursion or multiple loading.

   * If loading fails, the loader must remove any modules it has inserted into
     |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|, but it must remove *only* the failing module(s), and only if the
     loader itself has loaded the module(s) explicitly.

Changed in version 3.5: A |:library/exceptions.txt/DeprecationWarning:DeprecationWarning| is raised when "exec_module()" is
defined but "create_module()" is not.

Changed in version 3.6: An |:library/exceptions.txt/ImportError:ImportError| is raised when "exec_module()" is
defined but "create_module()" is not.

## submodules:Submodules

When a submodule is loaded using any mechanism (e.g. "importlib" APIs, the "
import" or "import-from" statements, or built-in "__import__()") a binding is
placed in the parent module’s namespace to the submodule object. For example, if
package "spam" has a submodule "foo", after importing "spam.foo", "spam" will
have an attribute "foo" which is bound to the submodule.  Let’s say you have the
following directory structure:

```rst
spam/
    __init__.py
    foo.py
    bar.py
```

and "spam/__init__.py" has the following lines in it:

```rst
from .foo import Foo
from .bar import Bar
```

then executing the following puts a name binding to "foo" and "bar" in the "spam
" module:

```rst
>>> import spam
>>> spam.foo
<module 'spam.foo' from '/tmp/imports/spam/foo.py'>
>>> spam.bar
<module 'spam.bar' from '/tmp/imports/spam/bar.py'>
```

Given Python’s familiar name binding rules this might seem surprising, but it’s
actually a fundamental feature of the import system.  The invariant holding is
that if you have "sys.modules['spam']" and "sys.modules['spam.foo']" (as you
would after the above import), the latter must appear as the "foo" attribute of
the former.

## module-spec:Module spec

The import machinery uses a variety of information about each module during
import, especially before loading.  Most of the information is common to all
modules.  The purpose of a module’s spec is to encapsulate this import-related
information on a per-module basis.

Using a spec during import allows state to be transferred between import system
components, e.g. between the finder that creates the module spec and the loader
that executes it.  Most importantly, it allows the import machinery to perform
the boilerplate operations of loading, whereas without a module spec the loader
had that responsibility.

The module’s spec is exposed as the "__spec__" attribute on a module object. See
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec:ModuleSpec| for details on the contents of the module spec.

New in version 3.4.

*|import-mod-attrs:⚓|* ## import-related-module-attributes:Import-related module
attributes

The import machinery fills in these attributes on each module object during
loading, based on the module’s spec, before the loader executes the module.

*name__:__name__*

   The "__name__" attribute must be set to the fully-qualified name of the module.
   This name is used to uniquely identify the module in the import system.

*loader__:__loader__*

   The "__loader__" attribute must be set to the loader object that the import
   machinery used when loading the module.  This is mostly for introspection, but
   can be used for additional loader-specific functionality, for example getting
   data associated with a loader.

*package__:__package__*

   The module’s "__package__" attribute must be set.  Its value must be a string,
   but it can be the same value as its "__name__".  When the module is a package,
   its "__package__" value should be set to its "__name__".  When the module is not
   a package, "__package__" should be set to the empty string for top-level
   modules, or for submodules, to the parent package’s name.  See *|index-11:⚓|*
   |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366:PEP 366| for further details.

   This attribute is used instead of "__name__" to calculate explicit relative
   imports for main modules, as defined in *|index-12:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366:PEP 366|. It is expected
   to have the same value as "__spec__.parent".

   Changed in version 3.6: The value of "__package__" is expected to be the same as
   "__spec__.parent".

*spec__:__spec__*

   The "__spec__" attribute must be set to the module spec that was used when
   importing the module. Setting "__spec__" appropriately applies equally to
   |:reference/toplevel_components.txt/programs:modules initialized during
interpreter startup|.  The one exception is "
   __main__", where "__spec__" is |:main-spec:set to None in some cases|.

   When "__package__" is not defined, "__spec__.parent" is used as a fallback.

   New in version 3.4.

   Changed in version 3.6: "__spec__.parent" is used as a fallback when "
   __package__" is not defined.

*path__:__path__*

   If the module is a package (either regular or namespace), the module object’s "
   __path__" attribute must be set.  The value must be iterable, but may be empty
   if "__path__" has no further significance. If "__path__" is not empty, it must
   produce strings when iterated over. More details on the semantics of "__path__"
   are given |:package-path-rules:below|.

   Non-package modules should not have a "__path__" attribute.

*file__:__file__*

*cached__:__cached__*

   "__file__" is optional. If set, this attribute’s value must be a string.  The
   import system may opt to leave "__file__" unset if it has no semantic meaning
   (e.g. a module loaded from a database).

   If "__file__" is set, it may also be appropriate to set the "__cached__"
   attribute which is the path to any compiled version of the code (e.g. byte-
   compiled file). The file does not need to exist to set this attribute; the path
   can simply point to where the compiled file would exist (see *|index-13:⚓|*
   |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147:PEP 3147|).

   It is also appropriate to set "__cached__" when "__file__" is not set.  However,
   that scenario is quite atypical.  Ultimately, the loader is what makes use of "
   __file__" and/or "__cached__".  So if a loader can load from a cached module but
   otherwise does not load from a file, that atypical scenario may be appropriate.

*|package-path-rules:⚓|* ## module-path:module.__path__

By definition, if a module has a "__path__" attribute, it is a package.

A package’s "__path__" attribute is used during imports of its subpackages.
Within the import machinery, it functions much the same as |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path|, i.e.
providing a list of locations to search for modules during import. However, "
__path__" is typically much more constrained than |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path|.

"__path__" must be an iterable of strings, but it may be empty. The same rules
used for |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| also apply to a package’s "__path__", and |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_hooks:sys.path_hooks|
(described below) are consulted when traversing a package’s "__path__".

A package’s "__init__.py" file may set or alter the package’s "__path__"
attribute, and this was typically the way namespace packages were implemented
prior to *|index-14:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420|.  With the adoption of *|index-15:⚓|*
|:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420|, namespace packages no longer need to supply "__init__.py" files
containing only "__path__" manipulation code; the import machinery automatically
sets "__path__" correctly for the namespace package.

## module-reprs:Module reprs

By default, all modules have a usable repr, however depending on the attributes
set above, and in the module’s spec, you can more explicitly control the repr of
module objects.

If the module has a spec ("__spec__"), the import machinery will try to generate
a repr from it.  If that fails or there is no spec, the import system will craft
a default repr using whatever information is available on the module.  It will
try to use the "module.__name__", "module.__file__", and "module.__loader__" as
input into the repr, with defaults for whatever information is missing.

Here are the exact rules used:

   * If the module has a "__spec__" attribute, the information in the spec is used to
     generate the repr.  The “name”, “loader”, “origin”, and “has_location”
     attributes are consulted.

   * If the module has a "__file__" attribute, this is used as part of the module’s
     repr.

   * If the module has no "__file__" but does have a "__loader__" that is not "None",
     then the loader’s repr is used as part of the module’s repr.

   * Otherwise, just use the module’s "__name__" in the repr.

Changed in version 3.4: Use of |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.module_repr:loader.module_repr()| has been deprecated and
the module spec is now used by the import machinery to generate a module repr.
For backward compatibility with Python 3.3, the module repr will be generated by
calling the loader’s |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.Loader.module_repr:module_repr()| method, if defined, before trying either
approach described above.  However, the method is deprecated.

*|pyc-invalidation:⚓|* ## cached-bytecode-invalidation:Cached bytecode
invalidation

Before Python loads cached bytecode from a ".pyc" file, it checks whether the
cache is up-to-date with the source ".py" file. By default, Python does this by
storing the source’s last-modified timestamp and size in the cache file when
writing it. At runtime, the import system then validates the cache file by
checking the stored metadata in the cache file against the source’s metadata.

Python also supports “hash-based” cache files, which store a hash of the source
file’s contents rather than its metadata. There are two variants of hash-based "
.pyc" files: checked and unchecked. For checked hash-based ".pyc" files, Python
validates the cache file by hashing the source file and comparing the resulting
hash with the hash in the cache file. If a checked hash-based cache file is
found to be invalid, Python regenerates it and writes a new checked hash-based
cache file. For unchecked hash-based ".pyc" files, Python simply assumes the
cache file is valid if it exists. Hash-based ".pyc" files validation behavior
may be overridden with the |:using/cmdline.txt/cmdoption-check-hash-based-pycs:--check-hash-based-pycs| flag.

Changed in version 3.7: Added hash-based ".pyc" files. Previously, Python only
supported timestamp-based invalidation of bytecode caches.

# the-path-based-finder:The Path Based Finder*|index-16:⚓|*

As mentioned previously, Python comes with several default meta path finders.
One of these, called the |:glossary.txt/term-path-based-finder:path based finder| (|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.machinery.PathFinder:PathFinder|), searches an
|:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path|, which contains a list of |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry:path entries|.  Each path entry names a
location to search for modules.

The path based finder itself doesn’t know how to import anything. Instead, it
traverses the individual path entries, associating each of them with a path
entry finder that knows how to handle that particular kind of path.

The default set of path entry finders implement all the semantics for finding
modules on the file system, handling special file types such as Python source
code (".py" files), Python byte code (".pyc" files) and shared libraries (e.g. "
.so" files). When supported by the |:library/zipimport.txt/module-zipimport:zipimport| module in the standard library,
the default path entry finders also handle loading all of these file types
(other than shared libraries) from zipfiles.

Path entries need not be limited to file system locations.  They can refer to
URLs, database queries, or any other location that can be specified as a string.

The path based finder provides additional hooks and protocols so that you can
extend and customize the types of searchable path entries.  For example, if you
wanted to support path entries as network URLs, you could write a hook that
implements HTTP semantics to find modules on the web.  This hook (a callable)
would return a |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder| supporting the protocol described below,
which was then used to get a loader for the module from the web.

A word of warning: this section and the previous both use the term *finder*,
distinguishing between them by using the terms |:glossary.txt/term-meta-path-finder:meta path finder| and
|:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder|.  These two types of finders are very similar, support
similar protocols, and function in similar ways during the import process, but
it’s important to keep in mind that they are subtly different. In particular,
meta path finders operate at the beginning of the import process, as keyed off
the |:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path| traversal.

By contrast, path entry finders are in a sense an implementation detail of the
path based finder, and in fact, if the path based finder were to be removed from
|:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path|, none of the path entry finder semantics would be invoked.

## path-entry-finders:Path entry finders*|index-17:⚓|*

The |:glossary.txt/term-path-based-finder:path based finder| is responsible for finding and loading Python modules
and packages whose location is specified with a string |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry:path entry|.  Most path
entries name locations in the file system, but they need not be limited to this.

As a meta path finder, the |:glossary.txt/term-path-based-finder:path based finder| implements the |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()|
protocol previously described, however it exposes additional hooks that can be
used to customize how modules are found and loaded from the |:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path|.

Three variables are used by the |:glossary.txt/term-path-based-finder:path based finder|, |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path|,
|:library/sys.txt/sys.path_hooks:sys.path_hooks| and |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache|.  The "__path__" attributes on
package objects are also used.  These provide additional ways that the import
machinery can be customized.

|:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| contains a list of strings providing search locations for modules and
packages.  It is initialized from the "PYTHONPATH" environment variable and
various other installation- and implementation-specific defaults.  Entries in
|:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| can name directories on the file system, zip files, and potentially
other “locations” (see the |:library/site.txt/module-site:site| module) that should be searched for modules,
such as URLs, or database queries.  Only strings and bytes should be present on
|:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path|; all other data types are ignored.  The encoding of bytes entries is
determined by the individual |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finders|.

The |:glossary.txt/term-path-based-finder:path based finder| is a |:glossary.txt/term-meta-path-finder:meta path finder|, so the import machinery begins
the |:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path| search by calling the path based finder’s |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| method
as described previously.  When the "path" argument to |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| is given, it
will be a list of string paths to traverse - typically a package’s "__path__"
attribute for an import within that package.  If the "path" argument is "None",
this indicates a top level import and |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| is used.

The path based finder iterates over every entry in the search path, and for each
of these, looks for an appropriate |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder| (|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder:PathEntryFinder|) for
the path entry.  Because this can be an expensive operation (e.g. there may be *
stat()* call overheads for this search), the path based finder maintains a cache
mapping path entries to path entry finders.  This cache is maintained in
|:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache| (despite the name, this cache actually stores finder
objects rather than being limited to |:glossary.txt/term-importer:importer| objects). In this way, the
expensive search for a particular |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry:path entry| location’s |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder|
need only be done once.  User code is free to remove cache entries from
|:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache| forcing the path based finder to perform the path
entry search again [3].

If the path entry is not present in the cache, the path based finder iterates
over every callable in |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_hooks:sys.path_hooks|.  Each of the |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-hook:path entry
hooks| in this
list is called with a single argument, the path entry to be searched.  This
callable may either return a |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path
entry finder| that can handle the path entry,
or it may raise |:library/exceptions.txt/ImportError:ImportError|.  An |:library/exceptions.txt/ImportError:ImportError| is used by the path based
finder to signal that the hook cannot find a |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder| for that
|:glossary.txt/term-path-entry:path entry|.  The exception is ignored and |:glossary.txt/term-import-path:import path| iteration continues.
The hook should expect either a string or bytes object; the encoding of bytes
objects is up to the hook (e.g. it may be a file system encoding, UTF-8, or
something else), and if the hook cannot decode the argument, it should raise
|:library/exceptions.txt/ImportError:ImportError|.

If |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_hooks:sys.path_hooks| iteration ends with no |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder| being returned,
then the path based finder’s |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| method will store "None" in
|:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache| (to indicate that there is no finder for this path
entry) and return "None", indicating that this |:glossary.txt/term-meta-path-finder:meta path finder| could not find
the module.

If a |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-finder:path entry finder| *is* returned by one of the |:glossary.txt/term-path-entry-hook:path entry
hook| callables
on |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_hooks:sys.path_hooks|, then the following protocol is used to ask the finder for a
module spec, which is then used when loading the module.

The current working directory – denoted by an empty string – is handled slightly
differently from other entries on |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path|. First, if the current working
directory is found to not exist, no value is stored in |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache|
. Second, the value for the current working directory is looked up fresh for
each module lookup. Third, the path used for |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache| and
returned by |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec:importlib.machinery.PathFinder.find_spec()| will be the actual
current working directory and not the empty string.

## path-entry-finder-protocol:Path entry finder protocol

In order to support imports of modules and initialized packages and also to
contribute portions to namespace packages, path entry finders must implement the
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| method.

|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| takes two arguments: the fully qualified name of the module being
imported, and the (optional) target module.  "find_spec()" returns a fully
populated spec for the module. This spec will always have “loader” set (with one
exception).

To indicate to the import machinery that the spec represents a namespace
|:glossary.txt/term-portion:portion|, the path entry finder sets “submodule_search_locations” to a list
containing the portion.

Changed in version 3.4: |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| replaced |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_loader:find_loader()| and
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_module:find_module()|, both of which are now deprecated, but will be used if "
find_spec()" is not defined.Older path entry finders may implement one of these
two deprecated methods instead of "find_spec()".  The methods are still
respected for the sake of backward compatibility.  However, if "find_spec()" is
implemented on the path entry finder, the legacy methods are ignored.
|:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_loader:find_loader()| takes one argument, the fully qualified name of the module being
imported.  "find_loader()" returns a 2-tuple where the first item is the loader
and the second item is a namespace |:glossary.txt/term-portion:portion|.For backwards compatibility with
other implementations of the import protocol, many path entry finders also
support the same, traditional "find_module()" method that meta path finders
support. However path entry finder "find_module()" methods are never called with
a "path" argument (they are expected to record the appropriate path information
from the initial call to the path hook).The "find_module()" method on path entry
finders is deprecated, as it does not allow the path entry finder to contribute
portions to namespace packages.  If both "find_loader()" and "find_module()"
exist on a path entry finder, the import system will always call "find_loader()"
in preference to "find_module()".

# replacing-the-standard-import-system:Replacing the standard import system

The most reliable mechanism for replacing the entire import system is to delete
the default contents of |:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path|, replacing them entirely with a custom
meta path hook.

If it is acceptable to only alter the behaviour of import statements without
affecting other APIs that access the import system, then replacing the builtin
|:library/functions.txt/import__:__import__()| function may be sufficient. This technique may also be employed
at the module level to only alter the behaviour of import statements within that
module.

To selectively prevent the import of some modules from a hook early on the meta
path (rather than disabling the standard import system entirely), it is
sufficient to raise |:library/exceptions.txt/ModuleNotFoundError:ModuleNotFoundError| directly from |:library/importlib.txt/importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec:find_spec()| instead of
returning "None". The latter indicates that the meta path search should
continue, while raising an exception terminates it immediately.

*|relativeimports:⚓|* # package-relative-imports:Package Relative Imports

Relative imports use leading dots. A single leading dot indicates a relative
import, starting with the current package. Two or more leading dots indicate a
relative import to the parent(s) of the current package, one level per dot after
the first. For example, given the following package layout:

```rst
package/
    __init__.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleX.py
        moduleY.py
    subpackage2/
        __init__.py
        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py
```

In either "subpackage1/moduleX.py" or "subpackage1/__init__.py", the following
are valid relative imports:

```rst
from .moduleY import spam
from .moduleY import spam as ham
from . import moduleY
from ..subpackage1 import moduleY
from ..subpackage2.moduleZ import eggs
from ..moduleA import foo
```

Absolute imports may use either the "import <>" or "from <> import <>" syntax,
but relative imports may only use the second form; the reason for this is that:

```rst
import XXX.YYY.ZZZ
```

should expose "XXX.YYY.ZZZ" as a usable expression, but .moduleY is not a valid
expression.

# special-considerations-for-main:Special considerations for __main__

The |:library/__main__.txt/module-__main__:__main__| module is a special case relative to Python’s import system.  As
noted |:reference/toplevel_components.txt/programs:elsewhere|, the "__main__" module is directly initialized at interpreter
startup, much like |:library/sys.txt/module-sys:sys| and |:library/builtins.txt/module-builtins:builtins|.  However, unlike those two, it doesn’t
strictly qualify as a built-in module.  This is because the manner in which "
__main__" is initialized depends on the flags and other options with which the
interpreter is invoked.

## main-spec:__main__.__spec__

Depending on how |:library/__main__.txt/module-__main__:__main__| is initialized, "__main__.__spec__" gets set
appropriately or to "None".

When Python is started with the |:using/cmdline.txt/cmdoption-m:-m| option, "__spec__" is set to the module
spec of the corresponding module or package. "__spec__" is also populated when
the "__main__" module is loaded as part of executing a directory, zipfile or
other |:library/sys.txt/sys.path:sys.path| entry.

In |:using/cmdline.txt/using-on-interface-options:the remaining cases| "__main__.__spec__" is set to "None", as the code used
to populate the |:library/__main__.txt/module-__main__:__main__| does not correspond directly with an importable
module:

* interactive prompt

* |:using/cmdline.txt/cmdoption-c:-c| option

* running from stdin

* running directly from a source or bytecode file

Note that "__main__.__spec__" is always "None" in the last case, *even if* the
file could technically be imported directly as a module instead. Use the |:using/cmdline.txt/cmdoption-m:-m|
switch if valid module metadata is desired in |:library/__main__.txt/module-__main__:__main__|.

Note also that even when "__main__" corresponds with an importable module and "
__main__.__spec__" is set accordingly, they’re still considered *distinct*
modules. This is due to the fact that blocks guarded by "if __name__ ==
"__main__":" checks only execute when the module is used to populate the "
__main__" namespace, and not during normal import.

# open-issues:Open issues

# references:References

The import machinery has evolved considerably since Python’s early days.  The
original |:www.python.org/doc/essays/packages:specification for packages|*|specification-for-packages:⚓|*  is still
available to read, although some details have changed since the writing of that
document.

The original specification for |:library/sys.txt/sys.meta_path:sys.meta_path| was *|index-19:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302:PEP 302|,
with subsequent extension in *|index-20:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420|.

*|index-21:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420| introduced |:glossary.txt/term-namespace-package:namespace packages| for Python 3.3.
*|index-22:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420:PEP 420| also introduced the "find_loader()" protocol as an
alternative to "find_module()".

*|index-23:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366:PEP 366| describes the addition of the "__package__" attribute
for explicit relative imports in main modules.

*|index-24:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328:PEP 328| introduced absolute and explicit relative imports and
initially proposed "__name__" for semantics *|index-25:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366:PEP 366| would
eventually specify for "__package__".

*|index-26:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0338:PEP 338| defines executing modules as scripts.

*|index-27:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0451:PEP 451| adds the encapsulation of per-module import state in
spec objects.  It also off-loads most of the boilerplate responsibilities of
loaders back onto the import machinery.  These changes allow the deprecation of
several APIs in the import system and also addition of new methods to finders
and loaders.

-[ Footnotes ]-

[1] See |:library/types.txt/types.ModuleType:types.ModuleType|.

[2] The importlib implementation avoids using the return value directly. Instead, it
    gets the module object by looking the module name up in |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|.  The
    indirect effect of this is that an imported module may replace itself in
    |:library/sys.txt/sys.modules:sys.modules|.  This is implementation-specific behavior that is not guaranteed
    to work in other Python implementations.

[3] In legacy code, it is possible to find instances of |:library/imp.txt/imp.NullImporter:imp.NullImporter| in the
    |:library/sys.txt/sys.path_importer_cache:sys.path_importer_cache|.  It is recommended that code be changed to use "None"
    instead.  See |:whatsnew/3.3.txt/portingpythoncode:Porting Python code| for more details.
