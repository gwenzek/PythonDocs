*Source code:* |:github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib/dummy_threading.py:Lib/dummy_threading.py|

Deprecated since version 3.7: Python now always has threading enabled.  Please
use |:library/threading.txt/module-threading:threading| instead.

======================================================================

This module provides a duplicate interface to the |:library/threading.txt/module-threading:threading| module. It was
meant to be imported when the |:library/_thread.txt/module-_thread:_thread| module was not provided on a platform.

Be careful to not use this module where deadlock might occur from a thread being
created that blocks waiting for another thread to be created.  This often occurs
with blocking I/O.
