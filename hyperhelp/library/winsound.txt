*|module-winsound:⚓|*

======================================================================

The |:module-winsound:winsound| module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery
provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several constants.

*winsound.Beep:winsound.Beep(frequency, duration)*

   Beep the PC’s speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in hertz,
   of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The *duration*
   parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last.  If the
   system is not able to beep the speaker, |:library/exceptions.txt/RuntimeError:RuntimeError| is raised.

*winsound.PlaySound:winsound.PlaySound(sound, flags)*

   Call the underlying "PlaySound()" function from the Platform API.  The *sound*
   parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a
   |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|, or "None".  Its interpretation depends on the value of *
   flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants described
   below. If the *sound* parameter is "None", any currently playing waveform sound
   is stopped. If the system indicates an error, |:library/exceptions.txt/RuntimeError:RuntimeError| is raised.

*winsound.MessageBeep:winsound.MessageBeep(type=MB_OK)*

   Call the underlying "MessageBeep()" function from the Platform API.  This plays
   a sound as specified in the registry.  The *type* argument specifies which sound
   to play; possible values are "-1", "MB_ICONASTERISK", "MB_ICONEXCLAMATION", "
   MB_ICONHAND", "MB_ICONQUESTION", and "MB_OK", all described below.  The value "
   -1" produces a “simple beep”; this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be
   played otherwise.  If the system indicates an error, |:library/exceptions.txt/RuntimeError:RuntimeError| is raised.

*winsound.SND_FILENAME:winsound.SND_FILENAME*

   The *sound* parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with |:winsound.SND_ALIAS:SND_ALIAS|.

*winsound.SND_ALIAS:winsound.SND_ALIAS*

   The *sound* parameter is a sound association name from the registry.  If the
   registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless
   |:winsound.SND_NODEFAULT:SND_NODEFAULT| is also specified. If no default sound is registered, raise
   |:library/exceptions.txt/RuntimeError:RuntimeError|. Do not use with |:winsound.SND_FILENAME:SND_FILENAME|.

   All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems support many
   more:

   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | |:winsound.PlaySound:Play  | Corresponding Control Panel Sound name   |
   | Sound()| *name*            |                                          |
   |============================|==========================================|
   | "'SystemAsterisk'"         | Asterisk                                 |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemExclamation'"      | Exclamation                              |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemExit'"             | Exit Windows                             |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemHand'"             | Critical Stop                            |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemQuestion'"         | Question                                 |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+

   For example:

```rst
import winsound
# Play Windows exit sound.
winsound.PlaySound("SystemExit", winsound.SND_ALIAS)

# Probably play Windows default sound, if any is registered (because
# "*" probably isn't the registered name of any sound).
winsound.PlaySound("*", winsound.SND_ALIAS)
```

*winsound.SND_LOOP:winsound.SND_LOOP*

   Play the sound repeatedly.  The |:winsound.SND_ASYNC:SND_ASYNC| flag must also be used to avoid
   blocking.  Cannot be used with |:winsound.SND_MEMORY:SND_MEMORY|.

*winsound.SND_MEMORY:winsound.SND_MEMORY*

   The *sound* parameter to |:winsound.PlaySound:PlaySound()| is a memory image of a WAV file, as a
   |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

   Note:

     This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so a
     combination of this flag and |:winsound.SND_ASYNC:SND_ASYNC| will raise |:library/exceptions.txt/RuntimeError:RuntimeError|.

*winsound.SND_PURGE:winsound.SND_PURGE*

   Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.

   Note:

     This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

*winsound.SND_ASYNC:winsound.SND_ASYNC*

   Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.

*winsound.SND_NODEFAULT:winsound.SND_NODEFAULT*

   If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound.

*winsound.SND_NOSTOP:winsound.SND_NOSTOP*

   Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.

*winsound.SND_NOWAIT:winsound.SND_NOWAIT*

   Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.

   Note:

     This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

*winsound.MB_ICONASTERISK:winsound.MB_ICONASTERISK*

   Play the "SystemDefault" sound.

*winsound.MB_ICONEXCLAMATION:winsound.MB_ICONEXCLAMATION*

   Play the "SystemExclamation" sound.

*winsound.MB_ICONHAND:winsound.MB_ICONHAND*

   Play the "SystemHand" sound.

*winsound.MB_ICONQUESTION:winsound.MB_ICONQUESTION*

   Play the "SystemQuestion" sound.

*winsound.MB_OK:winsound.MB_OK*

   Play the "SystemDefault" sound.
