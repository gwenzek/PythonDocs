======================================================================

asyncio queues are designed to be similar to classes of the |:library/queue.txt/module-queue:queue| module.
Although asyncio queues are not thread-safe, they are designed to be used
specifically in async/await code.

Note that methods of asyncio queues don’t have a *timeout* parameter; use
|:library/asyncio-task.txt/asyncio.wait_for:asyncio.wait_for()| function to do queue operations with a timeout.

See also the |:examples:Examples| section below.

# queue:Queue

*asyncio.Queue:class asyncio.Queue(maxsize=0, \*, loop=None)*

   A first in, first out (FIFO) queue.

   If *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.  If it
   is an integer greater than "0", then "await put()" blocks when the queue reaches
   *maxsize* until an item is removed by |:asyncio.Queue.get:get()|.

   Unlike the standard library threading |:library/queue.txt/module-queue:queue|, the size of the queue is always
   known and can be returned by calling the |:asyncio.Queue.qsize:qsize()| method.

   Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The *loop*
   parameter.

   This class is |:library/asyncio-dev.txt/asyncio-multithreading:not thread safe|.

   *asyncio.Queue.maxsize:maxsize*

      Number of items allowed in the queue.

   *asyncio.Queue.empty:empty()*

      Return "True" if the queue is empty, "False" otherwise.

   *asyncio.Queue.full:full()*

      Return "True" if there are |:asyncio.Queue.maxsize:maxsize| items in the queue.

      If the queue was initialized with "maxsize=0" (the default), then |:asyncio.Queue.full:full()| never
      returns "True".

   *asyncio.Queue.get:coroutine get()*

      Remove and return an item from the queue. If queue is empty, wait until an item
      is available.

   *asyncio.Queue.get_nowait:get_nowait()*

      Return an item if one is immediately available, else raise |:asyncio.QueueEmpty:QueueEmpty|.

   *asyncio.Queue.join:coroutine join()*

      Block until all items in the queue have been received and processed.

      The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the queue.
      The count goes down whenever a consumer coroutine calls |:asyncio.Queue.task_done:task_done()| to
      indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on it is complete.  When the
      count of unfinished tasks drops to zero, |:asyncio.Queue.join:join()| unblocks.

   *asyncio.Queue.put:coroutine put(item)*

      Put an item into the queue. If the queue is full, wait until a free slot is
      available before adding the item.

   *asyncio.Queue.put_nowait:put_nowait(item)*

      Put an item into the queue without blocking.

      If no free slot is immediately available, raise |:asyncio.QueueFull:QueueFull|.

   *asyncio.Queue.qsize:qsize()*

      Return the number of items in the queue.

   *asyncio.Queue.task_done:task_done()*

      Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.

      Used by queue consumers. For each |:asyncio.Queue.get:get()| used to fetch a task, a subsequent
      call to |:asyncio.Queue.task_done:task_done()| tells the queue that the processing on the task is
      complete.

      If a |:asyncio.Queue.join:join()| is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have been
      processed (meaning that a |:asyncio.Queue.task_done:task_done()| call was received for every item that
      had been |:asyncio.Queue.put:put()| into the queue).

      Raises |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| if called more times than there were items placed in the
      queue.

# priority-queue:Priority Queue

*asyncio.PriorityQueue:class asyncio.PriorityQueue*

   A variant of |:asyncio.Queue:Queue|; retrieves entries in priority order (lowest first).

   Entries are typically tuples of the form "(priority_number, data)".

# lifo-queue:LIFO Queue

*asyncio.LifoQueue:class asyncio.LifoQueue*

   A variant of |:asyncio.Queue:Queue| that retrieves most recently added entries first (last in,
   first out).

# exceptions:Exceptions

*asyncio.QueueEmpty:exception asyncio.QueueEmpty*

   This exception is raised when the |:asyncio.Queue.get_nowait:get_nowait()| method is called on an empty
   queue.

*asyncio.QueueFull:exception asyncio.QueueFull*

   Exception raised when the |:asyncio.Queue.put_nowait:put_nowait()| method is called on a queue that has
   reached its *maxsize*.

Queues can be used to distribute workload between several concurrent tasks:

```rst
import asyncio
import random
import time


async def worker(name, queue):
    while True:
        # Get a "work item" out of the queue.
        sleep_for = await queue.get()

        # Sleep for the "sleep_for" seconds.
        await asyncio.sleep(sleep_for)

        # Notify the queue that the "work item" has been processed.
        queue.task_done()

        print(f'{name} has slept for {sleep_for:.2f} seconds')


async def main():
    # Create a queue that we will use to store our "workload".
    queue = asyncio.Queue()

    # Generate random timings and put them into the queue.
    total_sleep_time = 0
    for _ in range(20):
        sleep_for = random.uniform(0.05, 1.0)
        total_sleep_time += sleep_for
        queue.put_nowait(sleep_for)

    # Create three worker tasks to process the queue concurrently.
    tasks = []
    for i in range(3):
        task = asyncio.create_task(worker(f'worker-{i}', queue))
        tasks.append(task)

    # Wait until the queue is fully processed.
    started_at = time.monotonic()
    await queue.join()
    total_slept_for = time.monotonic() - started_at

    # Cancel our worker tasks.
    for task in tasks:
        task.cancel()
    # Wait until all worker tasks are cancelled.
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

    print('====')
    print(f'3 workers slept in parallel for {total_slept_for:.2f} seconds')
    print(f'total expected sleep time: {total_sleep_time:.2f} seconds')


asyncio.run(main())
```
