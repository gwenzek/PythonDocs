*|transports-and-protocols:⚓|*

-[ Preface ]-

Transports and Protocols are used by the *low-level* event loop APIs such as
|:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_connection:loop.create_connection()|.  They use callback-based programming style and
enable high-performance implementations of network or IPC protocols (e.g. HTTP).

Essentially, transports and protocols should only be used in libraries and
frameworks and never in high-level asyncio applications.

This documentation page covers both |:transports:Transports| and |:protocols:Protocols|.

-[ Introduction ]-

At the highest level, the transport is concerned with *how* bytes are
transmitted, while the protocol determines *which* bytes to transmit (and to
some extent when).

A different way of saying the same thing: a transport is an abstraction for a
socket (or similar I/O endpoint) while a protocol is an abstraction for an
application, from the transport’s point of view.

Yet another view is the transport and protocol interfaces together define an
abstract interface for using network I/O and interprocess I/O.

There is always a 1:1 relationship between transport and protocol objects: the
protocol calls transport methods to send data, while the transport calls
protocol methods to pass it data that has been received.

Most of connection oriented event loop methods (such as
|:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_connection:loop.create_connection()|) usually accept a *protocol_factory* argument used to
create a *Protocol* object for an accepted connection, represented by a *
Transport* object. Such methods usually return a tuple of "(transport, protocol)
".

# transports:Transports

======================================================================

Transports are classes provided by |:library/asyncio.txt/module-asyncio:asyncio| in order to abstract various kinds
of communication channels.

Transport objects are always instantiated by an |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio-event-loop:asyncio event loop|.

asyncio implements transports for TCP, UDP, SSL, and subprocess pipes. The
methods available on a transport depend on the transport’s kind.

The transport classes are |:library/asyncio-dev.txt/asyncio-multithreading:not thread safe|.

## transports-hierarchy:Transports Hierarchy

*asyncio.BaseTransport:class asyncio.BaseTransport*

   Base class for all transports.  Contains methods that all asyncio transports
   share.

*asyncio.WriteTransport:class asyncio.WriteTransport(BaseTransport)*

   A base transport for write-only connections.

   Instances of the *WriteTransport* class are returned from the
   |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.connect_write_pipe:loop.connect_write_pipe()| event loop method and are also used by subprocess-
   related methods like |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.subprocess_exec:loop.subprocess_exec()|.

*asyncio.ReadTransport:class asyncio.ReadTransport(BaseTransport)*

   A base transport for read-only connections.

   Instances of the *ReadTransport* class are returned from the
   |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.connect_read_pipe:loop.connect_read_pipe()| event loop method and are also used by subprocess-
   related methods like |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.subprocess_exec:loop.subprocess_exec()|.

*asyncio.Transport:class asyncio.Transport(WriteTransport, ReadTransport)*

   Interface representing a bidirectional transport, such as a TCP connection.

   The user does not instantiate a transport directly; they call a utility
   function, passing it a protocol factory and other information necessary to
   create the transport and protocol.

   Instances of the *Transport* class are returned from or used by event loop
   methods like |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_connection:loop.create_connection()|, |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_unix_connection:loop.create_unix_connection()|,
   |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_server:loop.create_server()|, |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.sendfile:loop.sendfile()|, etc.

*asyncio.DatagramTransport:class asyncio.DatagramTransport(BaseTransport)*

   A transport for datagram (UDP) connections.

   Instances of the *DatagramTransport* class are returned from the
   |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint:loop.create_datagram_endpoint()| event loop method.

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport:class asyncio.SubprocessTransport(BaseTransport)*

   An abstraction to represent a connection between a parent and its child OS
   process.

   Instances of the *SubprocessTransport* class are returned from event loop
   methods |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.subprocess_shell:loop.subprocess_shell()| and |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.subprocess_exec:loop.subprocess_exec()|.

## base-transport:Base Transport

*asyncio.BaseTransport.close:BaseTransport.close()*

   Close the transport.

   If the transport has a buffer for outgoing data, buffered data will be flushed
   asynchronously.  No more data will be received.  After all buffered data is
   flushed, the protocol’s |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.connection_lost:protocol.connection_lost()| method will be called with
   |:library/constants.txt/None:None| as its argument.

*asyncio.BaseTransport.is_closing:BaseTransport.is_closing()*

   Return "True" if the transport is closing or is closed.

*asyncio.BaseTransport.get_extra_info:BaseTransport.get_extra_info(name, default=None)*

   Return information about the transport or underlying resources it uses.

   *name* is a string representing the piece of transport-specific information to
   get.

   *default* is the value to return if the information is not available, or if the
   transport does not support querying it with the given third-party event loop
   implementation or on the current platform.

   For example, the following code attempts to get the underlying socket object of
   the transport:

```rst
sock = transport.get_extra_info('socket')
if sock is not None:
    print(sock.getsockopt(...))
```

   Categories of information that can be queried on some transports:

   * socket:

     * "'peername'": the remote address to which the socket is connected, result of
       |:library/socket.txt/socket.socket.getpeername:socket.socket.getpeername()| ("None" on error)

     * "'socket'": |:library/socket.txt/socket.socket:socket.socket| instance

     * "'sockname'": the socket’s own address, result of |:library/socket.txt/socket.socket.getsockname:socket.socket.getsockname()|

   * SSL socket:

     * "'compression'": the compression algorithm being used as a string, or "None" if
       the connection isn’t compressed; result of |:library/ssl.txt/ssl.SSLSocket.compression:ssl.SSLSocket.compression()|

     * "'cipher'": a three-value tuple containing the name of the cipher being used,
       the version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number of secret
       bits being used; result of |:library/ssl.txt/ssl.SSLSocket.cipher:ssl.SSLSocket.cipher()|

     * "'peercert'": peer certificate; result of |:library/ssl.txt/ssl.SSLSocket.getpeercert:ssl.SSLSocket.getpeercert()|

     * "'sslcontext'": |:library/ssl.txt/ssl.SSLContext:ssl.SSLContext| instance

     * "'ssl_object'": |:library/ssl.txt/ssl.SSLObject:ssl.SSLObject| or |:library/ssl.txt/ssl.SSLSocket:ssl.SSLSocket| instance

   * pipe:

     * "'pipe'": pipe object

   * subprocess:

     * "'subprocess'": |:library/subprocess.txt/subprocess.Popen:subprocess.Popen| instance

*asyncio.BaseTransport.set_protocol:BaseTransport.set_protocol(protocol)*

   Set a new protocol.

   Switching protocol should only be done when both protocols are documented to
   support the switch.

*asyncio.BaseTransport.get_protocol:BaseTransport.get_protocol()*

   Return the current protocol.

## read-only-transports:Read-only Transports

*asyncio.ReadTransport.is_reading:ReadTransport.is_reading()*

   Return "True" if the transport is receiving new data.

   New in version 3.7.

*asyncio.ReadTransport.pause_reading:ReadTransport.pause_reading()*

   Pause the receiving end of the transport.  No data will be passed to the
   protocol’s |:asyncio.Protocol.data_received:protocol.data_received()| method until |:asyncio.ReadTransport.resume_reading:resume_reading()| is called.

   Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
   transport is already paused or closed.

*asyncio.ReadTransport.resume_reading:ReadTransport.resume_reading()*

   Resume the receiving end.  The protocol’s |:asyncio.Protocol.data_received:protocol.data_received()| method will
   be called once again if some data is available for reading.

   Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
   transport is already reading.

## write-only-transports:Write-only Transports

*asyncio.WriteTransport.abort:WriteTransport.abort()*

   Close the transport immediately, without waiting for pending operations to
   complete.  Buffered data will be lost.  No more data will be received. The
   protocol’s |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.connection_lost:protocol.connection_lost()| method will eventually be called with
   |:library/constants.txt/None:None| as its argument.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.can_write_eof:WriteTransport.can_write_eof()*

   Return |:library/constants.txt/True:True| if the transport supports |:asyncio.WriteTransport.write_eof:write_eof()|, |:library/constants.txt/False:False| if not.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.get_write_buffer_size:WriteTransport.get_write_buffer_size()*

   Return the current size of the output buffer used by the transport.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.get_write_buffer_limits:WriteTransport.get_write_buffer_limits()*

   Get the *high* and *low* watermarks for write flow control. Return a tuple "
   (low, high)" where *low* and *high* are positive number of bytes.

   Use |:asyncio.WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits:set_write_buffer_limits()| to set the limits.

   New in version 3.4.2.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits:WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits(high=None, low=None)*

   Set the *high* and *low* watermarks for write flow control.

   These two values (measured in number of bytes) control when the protocol’s
   |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.pause_writing:protocol.pause_writing()| and |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.resume_writing:protocol.resume_writing()| methods are called.
   If specified, the low watermark must be less than or equal to the high
   watermark.  Neither *high* nor *low* can be negative.

   |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.pause_writing:pause_writing()| is called when the buffer size becomes greater than or equal
   to the *high* value. If writing has been paused, |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.resume_writing:resume_writing()| is called
   when the buffer size becomes less than or equal to the *low* value.

   The defaults are implementation-specific.  If only the high watermark is given,
   the low watermark defaults to an implementation-specific value less than or
   equal to the high watermark.  Setting *high* to zero forces *low* to zero as
   well, and causes |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.pause_writing:pause_writing()| to be called whenever the buffer becomes non-
   empty.  Setting *low* to zero causes |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.resume_writing:resume_writing()| to be called only once
   the buffer is empty. Use of zero for either limit is generally sub-optimal as it
   reduces opportunities for doing I/O and computation concurrently.

   Use |:asyncio.WriteTransport.get_write_buffer_limits:get_write_buffer_limits()| to get the limits.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.write:WriteTransport.write(data)*

   Write some *data* bytes to the transport.

   This method does not block; it buffers the data and arranges for it to be sent
   out asynchronously.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.writelines:WriteTransport.writelines(list_of_data)*

   Write a list (or any iterable) of data bytes to the transport. This is
   functionally equivalent to calling |:asyncio.WriteTransport.write:write()| on each element yielded by the
   iterable, but may be implemented more efficiently.

*asyncio.WriteTransport.write_eof:WriteTransport.write_eof()*

   Close the write end of the transport after flushing all buffered data. Data may
   still be received.

   This method can raise |:library/exceptions.txt/NotImplementedError:NotImplementedError| if the transport (e.g. SSL) doesn’t
   support half-closed connections.

## datagram-transports:Datagram Transports

*asyncio.DatagramTransport.sendto:DatagramTransport.sendto(data, addr=None)*

   Send the *data* bytes to the remote peer given by *addr* (a transport-dependent
   target address).  If *addr* is |:library/constants.txt/None:None|, the data is sent to the target address
   given on transport creation.

   This method does not block; it buffers the data and arranges for it to be sent
   out asynchronously.

*asyncio.DatagramTransport.abort:DatagramTransport.abort()*

   Close the transport immediately, without waiting for pending operations to
   complete.  Buffered data will be lost. No more data will be received.  The
   protocol’s |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.connection_lost:protocol.connection_lost()| method will eventually be called with
   |:library/constants.txt/None:None| as its argument.

*|asyncio-subprocess-transports:⚓|* ## subprocess-transports:Subprocess
Transports

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.get_pid:SubprocessTransport.get_pid()*

   Return the subprocess process id as an integer.

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.get_pipe_transport:SubprocessTransport.get_pipe_transport(fd)*

   Return the transport for the communication pipe corresponding to the integer
   file descriptor *fd*:

   * "0": readable streaming transport of the standard input (*stdin*), or |:library/constants.txt/None:None| if
     the subprocess was not created with "stdin=PIPE"

   * "1": writable streaming transport of the standard output (*stdout*), or |:library/constants.txt/None:None|
     if the subprocess was not created with "stdout=PIPE"

   * "2": writable streaming transport of the standard error (*stderr*), or |:library/constants.txt/None:None| if
     the subprocess was not created with "stderr=PIPE"

   * other *fd*: |:library/constants.txt/None:None|

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.get_returncode:SubprocessTransport.get_returncode()*

   Return the subprocess return code as an integer or |:library/constants.txt/None:None| if it hasn’t returned,
   which is similar to the |:library/subprocess.txt/subprocess.Popen.returncode:subprocess.Popen.returncode| attribute.

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.kill:SubprocessTransport.kill()*

   Kill the subprocess.

   On POSIX systems, the function sends SIGKILL to the subprocess. On Windows, this
   method is an alias for |:asyncio.SubprocessTransport.terminate:terminate()|.

   See also |:library/subprocess.txt/subprocess.Popen.kill:subprocess.Popen.kill()|.

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.send_signal:SubprocessTransport.send_signal(signal)*

   Send the *signal* number to the subprocess, as in
   |:library/subprocess.txt/subprocess.Popen.send_signal:subprocess.Popen.send_signal()|.

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.terminate:SubprocessTransport.terminate()*

   Stop the subprocess.

   On POSIX systems, this method sends SIGTERM to the subprocess. On Windows, the
   Windows API function TerminateProcess() is called to stop the subprocess.

   See also |:library/subprocess.txt/subprocess.Popen.terminate:subprocess.Popen.terminate()|.

*asyncio.SubprocessTransport.close:SubprocessTransport.close()*

   Kill the subprocess by calling the |:asyncio.SubprocessTransport.kill:kill()| method.

   If the subprocess hasn’t returned yet, and close transports of *stdin*, *stdout*
   , and *stderr* pipes.

*|asyncio-protocol:⚓|* # protocols:Protocols

*Source code:* |:github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib/asyncio/protocols.py:Lib/asyncio/protocols.py|

======================================================================

asyncio provides a set of abstract base classes that should be used to implement
network protocols.  Those classes are meant to be used together with
|:asyncio-transport:transports|.

Subclasses of abstract base protocol classes may implement some or all methods.
All these methods are callbacks: they are called by transports on certain
events, for example when some data is received. A base protocol method should be
called by the corresponding transport.

## base-protocols:Base Protocols

*asyncio.BaseProtocol:class asyncio.BaseProtocol*

   Base protocol with methods that all protocols share.

*asyncio.Protocol:class asyncio.Protocol(BaseProtocol)*

   The base class for implementing streaming protocols (TCP, Unix sockets, etc).

*asyncio.BufferedProtocol:class asyncio.BufferedProtocol(BaseProtocol)*

   A base class for implementing streaming protocols with manual control of the
   receive buffer.

*asyncio.DatagramProtocol:class asyncio.DatagramProtocol(BaseProtocol)*

   The base class for implementing datagram (UDP) protocols.

*asyncio.SubprocessProtocol:class asyncio.SubprocessProtocol(BaseProtocol)*

   The base class for implementing protocols communicating with child processes
   (unidirectional pipes).

## base-protocol:Base Protocol

All asyncio protocols can implement Base Protocol callbacks.

-[ Connection Callbacks ]-

Connection callbacks are called on all protocols, exactly once per a successful
connection.  All other protocol callbacks can only be called between those two
methods.

*asyncio.BaseProtocol.connection_made:BaseProtocol.connection_made(transport)*

   Called when a connection is made.

   The *transport* argument is the transport representing the connection.  The
   protocol is responsible for storing the reference to its transport.

*asyncio.BaseProtocol.connection_lost:BaseProtocol.connection_lost(exc)*

   Called when the connection is lost or closed.

   The argument is either an exception object or |:library/constants.txt/None:None|. The latter means a regular
   EOF is received, or the connection was aborted or closed by this side of the
   connection.

-[ Flow Control Callbacks ]-

Flow control callbacks can be called by transports to pause or resume writing
performed by the protocol.

See the documentation of the |:asyncio.WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits:set_write_buffer_limits()| method for more
details.

*asyncio.BaseProtocol.pause_writing:BaseProtocol.pause_writing()*

   Called when the transport’s buffer goes over the high watermark.

*asyncio.BaseProtocol.resume_writing:BaseProtocol.resume_writing()*

   Called when the transport’s buffer drains below the low watermark.

If the buffer size equals the high watermark, |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.pause_writing:pause_writing()| is not called:
the buffer size must go strictly over.

Conversely, |:asyncio.BaseProtocol.resume_writing:resume_writing()| is called when the buffer size is equal or lower
than the low watermark.  These end conditions are important to ensure that
things go as expected when either mark is zero.

## streaming-protocols:Streaming Protocols

Event methods, such as |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_server:loop.create_server()|, |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_unix_server:loop.create_unix_server()|,
|:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_connection:loop.create_connection()|, |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_unix_connection:loop.create_unix_connection()|,
|:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.connect_accepted_socket:loop.connect_accepted_socket()|, |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.connect_read_pipe:loop.connect_read_pipe()|, and
|:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.connect_write_pipe:loop.connect_write_pipe()| accept factories that return streaming protocols.

*asyncio.Protocol.data_received:Protocol.data_received(data)*

   Called when some data is received.  *data* is a non-empty bytes object
   containing the incoming data.

   Whether the data is buffered, chunked or reassembled depends on the transport.
   In general, you shouldn’t rely on specific semantics and instead make your
   parsing generic and flexible. However, data is always received in the correct
   order.

   The method can be called an arbitrary number of times while a connection is
   open.

   However, |:asyncio.Protocol.eof_received:protocol.eof_received()| is called at most once.  Once *eof_received()
   * is called, "data_received()" is not called anymore.

*asyncio.Protocol.eof_received:Protocol.eof_received()*

   Called when the other end signals it won’t send any more data (for example by
   calling |:asyncio.WriteTransport.write_eof:transport.write_eof()|, if the other end also uses asyncio).

   This method may return a false value (including "None"), in which case the
   transport will close itself.  Conversely, if this method returns a true value,
   the protocol used determines whether to close the transport. Since the default
   implementation returns "None", it implicitly closes the connection.

   Some transports, including SSL, don’t support half-closed connections, in which
   case returning true from this method will result in the connection being closed.

State machine:

```rst
start -> connection_made
    [-> data_received]*
    [-> eof_received]?
-> connection_lost -> end
```

## buffered-streaming-protocols:Buffered Streaming Protocols

New in version 3.7: *Important:* this has been added to asyncio in Python 3.7 *
on a provisional basis*!  This is as an experimental API that might be changed
or removed completely in Python 3.8.

Buffered Protocols can be used with any event loop method that supports
|:streaming-protocols:Streaming Protocols|.

"BufferedProtocol" implementations allow explicit manual allocation and control
of the receive buffer.  Event loops can then use the buffer provided by the
protocol to avoid unnecessary data copies.  This can result in noticeable
performance improvement for protocols that receive big amounts of data.
Sophisticated protocol implementations can significantly reduce the number of
buffer allocations.

The following callbacks are called on |:asyncio.BufferedProtocol:BufferedProtocol| instances:

*asyncio.BufferedProtocol.get_buffer:BufferedProtocol.get_buffer(sizehint)*

   Called to allocate a new receive buffer.

   *sizehint* is the recommended minimum size for the returned buffer.  It is
   acceptable to return smaller or larger buffers than what *sizehint* suggests.
   When set to -1, the buffer size can be arbitrary. It is an error to return a
   buffer with a zero size.

   "get_buffer()" must return an object implementing the |:c-api/buffer.txt/bufferobjects:buffer protocol|.

*asyncio.BufferedProtocol.buffer_updated:BufferedProtocol.buffer_updated(nbytes)*

   Called when the buffer was updated with the received data.

   *nbytes* is the total number of bytes that were written to the buffer.

*asyncio.BufferedProtocol.eof_received:BufferedProtocol.eof_received()*

   See the documentation of the |:asyncio.Protocol.eof_received:protocol.eof_received()| method.

|:asyncio.BufferedProtocol.get_buffer:get_buffer()| can be called an arbitrary number of times during a connection.
However, |:asyncio.Protocol.eof_received:protocol.eof_received()| is called at most once and, if called,
|:asyncio.BufferedProtocol.get_buffer:get_buffer()| and |:asyncio.BufferedProtocol.buffer_updated:buffer_updated()| won’t be called after it.

State machine:

```rst
start -> connection_made
    [-> get_buffer
        [-> buffer_updated]?
    ]*
    [-> eof_received]?
-> connection_lost -> end
```

## datagram-protocols:Datagram Protocols

Datagram Protocol instances should be constructed by protocol factories passed
to the |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint:loop.create_datagram_endpoint()| method.

*asyncio.DatagramProtocol.datagram_received:DatagramProtocol.datagram_received(data, addr)*

   Called when a datagram is received.  *data* is a bytes object containing the
   incoming data.  *addr* is the address of the peer sending the data; the exact
   format depends on the transport.

*asyncio.DatagramProtocol.error_received:DatagramProtocol.error_received(exc)*

   Called when a previous send or receive operation raises an |:library/exceptions.txt/OSError:OSError|.  *exc* is
   the |:library/exceptions.txt/OSError:OSError| instance.

   This method is called in rare conditions, when the transport (e.g. UDP) detects
   that a datagram could not be delivered to its recipient. In many conditions
   though, undeliverable datagrams will be silently dropped.

Note:

  On BSD systems (macOS, FreeBSD, etc.) flow control is not supported for datagram
  protocols, because there is no reliable way to detect send failures caused by
  writing too many packets.The socket always appears ‘ready’ and excess packets
  are dropped. An |:library/exceptions.txt/OSError:OSError| with "errno" set to |:library/errno.txt/errno.ENOBUFS:errno.ENOBUFS| may or may not be
  raised; if it is raised, it will be reported to
  |:asyncio.DatagramProtocol.error_received:DatagramProtocol.error_received()| but otherwise ignored.

*|asyncio-subprocess-protocols:⚓|* ## subprocess-protocols:Subprocess Protocols

Datagram Protocol instances should be constructed by protocol factories passed
to the |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.subprocess_exec:loop.subprocess_exec()| and |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.subprocess_shell:loop.subprocess_shell()| methods.

*asyncio.SubprocessProtocol.pipe_data_received:SubprocessProtocol.pipe_data_received(fd, data)*

   Called when the child process writes data into its stdout or stderr pipe.

   *fd* is the integer file descriptor of the pipe.

   *data* is a non-empty bytes object containing the received data.

*asyncio.SubprocessProtocol.pipe_connection_lost:SubprocessProtocol.pipe_connection_lost(fd, exc)*

   Called when one of the pipes communicating with the child process is closed.

   *fd* is the integer file descriptor that was closed.

*asyncio.SubprocessProtocol.process_exited:SubprocessProtocol.process_exited()*

   Called when the child process has exited.

# examples:Examples## tcp-echo-server:TCP Echo Server

Create a TCP echo server using the |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_server:loop.create_server()| method, send back
received data, and close the connection:

```rst
import asyncio


class EchoServerProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):
    def connection_made(self, transport):
        peername = transport.get_extra_info('peername')
        print('Connection from {}'.format(peername))
        self.transport = transport

    def data_received(self, data):
        message = data.decode()
        print('Data received: {!r}'.format(message))

        print('Send: {!r}'.format(message))
        self.transport.write(data)

        print('Close the client socket')
        self.transport.close()


async def main():
    # Get a reference to the event loop as we plan to use
    # low-level APIs.
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

    server = await loop.create_server(
        lambda: EchoServerProtocol(),
        '127.0.0.1', 8888)

    async with server:
        await server.serve_forever()


asyncio.run(main())
```

  |:library/asyncio-stream.txt/asyncio.start_server:asyncio.start_server()| function.

*|asyncio-example-tcp-echo-client-protocol:⚓|* ## tcp-echo-client:TCP Echo
Client

A TCP echo client using the |:library/asyncio-eventloop.txt/asyncio.loop.create_connection:loop.create_connection()| method, sends data, and
waits until the connection is closed:

```rst
import asyncio


class EchoClientProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):
    def __init__(self, message, on_con_lost):
        self.message = message
        self.on_con_lost = on_con_lost

    def connection_made(self, transport):
        transport.write(self.message.encode())
