*|built-in-types:⚓|*

The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the
interpreter.

*|index-0:⚓|*

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes,
instances and exceptions.

Some collection classes are mutable.  The methods that add, subtract, or
rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return
the collection instance itself but "None".

Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular,
practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value,
and converted to a string (with the |:library/functions.txt/repr:repr()| function or the slightly different
|:str:str()| function).  The latter function is implicitly used when an object is
written by the |:library/functions.txt/print:print()| function.

# truth-value-testing:Truth Value Testing*|index-1:⚓|*

Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/if:if| or |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/while:while|
condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.

*|index-2:⚓|*

By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a "
__bool__()" method that returns "False" or a "__len__()" method that returns
zero, when called with the object. [1]  Here are most of the built-in objects
considered false:

   *|index-3:⚓|*

* constants defined to be false: "None" and "False".

* zero of any numeric type: "0", "0.0", "0j", "Decimal(0)", "Fraction(0, 1)"

* empty sequences and collections: "''", "()", "[]", "{}", "set()", "range(0)"

*|index-4:⚓|*

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return "0"
or "False" for false and "1" or "True" for true, unless otherwise stated.
(Important exception: the Boolean operations "or" and "and" always return one of
their operands.)

*|boolean:⚓|* # boolean-operations-and-or-not:Boolean Operations — "and", "or",
"not"*|index-5:⚓|*

These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:

+---------------+-----------------------------------+---------+
| Operation     | Result                            | Notes   |
|===============|===================================|=========|
| "x or y"      | if *x* is false, then *y*, else   | (1)     |
|               | *x*                               |         |
+---------------+-----------------------------------+---------+
| "x and y"     | if *x* is false, then *x*, else   | (2)     |
|               | *y*                               |         |
+---------------+-----------------------------------+---------+
| "not x"       | if *x* is false, then "True",     | (3)     |
|               | else "False"                      |         |
+---------------+-----------------------------------+---------+

*|index-6:⚓|*

Notes:

1. This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if
   the first one is false.

2. This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if
   the first one is true.

3. "not" has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so "not a == b" is
   interpreted as "not (a == b)", and "a == not b" is a syntax error.

*|stdcomparisons:⚓|* # comparisons:Comparisons*|index-7:⚓|*

There are eight comparison operations in Python.  They all have the same
priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations).  Comparisons can
be chained arbitrarily; for example, "x < y <= z" is equivalent to "x < y and y
<= z", except that *y* is evaluated only once (but in both cases *z* is not
evaluated at all when "x < y" is found to be false).

This table summarizes the comparison operations:

+--------------+---------------------------+
| Operation    | Meaning                   |
|==============|===========================|
| "<"          | strictly less than        |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| "<="         | less than or equal        |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| ">"          | strictly greater than     |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| ">="         | greater than or equal     |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| "=="         | equal                     |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| "!="         | not equal                 |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| "is"         | object identity           |
+--------------+---------------------------+
| "is not"     | negated object identity   |
+--------------+---------------------------+

*|index-8:⚓|*

Objects of different types, except different numeric types, never compare equal.
The "==" operator is always defined but for some object types (for example,
class objects) is equivalent to |:reference/expressions.txt/is:is|. The "<", "<=", ">" and ">=" operators are
only defined where they make sense; for example, they raise a |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError|
exception when one of the arguments is a complex number.

*|index-9:⚓|*

Non-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the
class defines the "__eq__()" method.

Instances of a class cannot be ordered with respect to other instances of the
same class, or other types of object, unless the class defines enough of the
methods "__lt__()", "__le__()", "__gt__()", and "__ge__()" (in general, "
__lt__()" and "__eq__()" are sufficient, if you want the conventional meanings
of the comparison operators).

The behavior of the |:reference/expressions.txt/is:is| and |:reference/expressions.txt/is-not:is not| operators cannot be customized; also they
can be applied to any two objects and never raise an exception.

*|index-10:⚓|*

Two more operations with the same syntactic priority, |:reference/expressions.txt/in:in| and |:reference/expressions.txt/not-in:not in|, are
supported by types that are |:glossary.txt/term-iterable:iterable| or implement the "__contains__()" method.

*|typesnumeric:⚓|* # numeric-types-int-float-complex:Numeric Types — |:library/functions.txt/int:int|,
|:library/functions.txt/float:float|, |:library/functions.txt/complex:complex|*|index-11:⚓|*

There are three distinct numeric types: *integers*, *floating point numbers*,
and *complex numbers*.  In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers.
Integers have unlimited precision.  Floating point numbers are usually
implemented using *double* in C; information about the precision and internal
representation of floating point numbers for the machine on which your program
is running is available in |:library/sys.txt/sys.float_info:sys.float_info|.  Complex numbers have a real and
imaginary part, which are each a floating point number.  To extract these parts
from a complex number *z*, use "z.real" and "z.imag". (The standard library
includes the additional numeric types |:library/fractions.txt/fractions.Fraction:fractions.Fraction|, for rationals, and
|:library/decimal.txt/decimal.Decimal:decimal.Decimal|, for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.)

*|index-12:⚓|*

Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions
and operators.  Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary
numbers) yield integers.  Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an
exponent sign yield floating point numbers.  Appending "'j'" or "'J'" to a
numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real
part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real
and imaginary parts.

*|index-13:⚓|*

Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has
operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is
widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point,
which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types
behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. [2]

The constructors |:library/functions.txt/int:int()|, |:library/functions.txt/float:float()|, and |:library/functions.txt/complex:complex()| can be used to produce
numbers of a specific type.

All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for
priorities of the operations, see |:reference/expressions.txt/operator-summary:Operator precedence|):

Notes:

1. Also referred to as integer division.  The resultant value is a whole integer,
   though the result’s type is not necessarily int.  The result is always rounded
   towards minus infinity: "1//2" is "0", "(-1)//2" is "-1", "1//(-2)" is "-1", and
   "(-1)//(-2)" is "0".

2. Not for complex numbers.  Instead convert to floats using |:library/functions.txt/abs:abs()| if
   appropriate.

3. *|index-15:⚓|*

   Conversion from floating point to integer may round or truncate as in C; see
   functions |:library/math.txt/math.floor:math.floor()| and |:library/math.txt/math.ceil:math.ceil()| for well-defined conversions.

4. float also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+” or
   “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.

5. Python defines "pow(0, 0)" and "0 ** 0" to be "1", as is common for programming
   languages.

6. The numeric literals accepted include the digits "0" to "9" or any Unicode
   equivalent (code points with the "Nd" property).

   See |:www.unicode.org/Public/12.1.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedNumericType.txt:http://www.unicode.org/Public/12.1.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedNumericType.txt|
   for a complete list of code points with the "Nd" property.

All |:library/numbers.txt/numbers.Real:numbers.Real| types (|:library/functions.txt/int:int| and |:library/functions.txt/float:float|) also include the following
operations:

## bitwise-operations-on-integer-types:Bitwise Operations on Integer Types
*|index-16:⚓|*

Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise
operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an
infinite number of sign bits.

The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric
operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation "~" has the same
priority as the other unary numeric operations ("+" and "-").

This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority:

+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| Operation    | Result                           | Notes      |
|==============|==================================|============|
| "x | y"      | bitwise *or* of *x* and *y*      | (4)        |
+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "x ^ y"      | bitwise *exclusive or* of *x*    | (4)        |
|              | and *y*                          |            |
+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "x & y"      | bitwise *and* of *x* and *y*     | (4)        |
+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "x << n"     | *x* shifted left by *n* bits     | (1)(2)     |
+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "x >> n"     | *x* shifted right by *n* bits    | (1)(3)     |
+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| "~x"         | the bits of *x* inverted         |            |
+--------------+----------------------------------+------------+

Notes:

1. Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| to be raised.

2. A left shift by *n* bits is equivalent to multiplication by "pow(2, n)".

3. A right shift by *n* bits is equivalent to floor division by "pow(2, n)".

4. Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a
   finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of "1 +
   max(x.bit_length(), y.bit_length())" or more) is sufficient to get the same
   result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits.

## additional-methods-on-integer-types:Additional Methods on Integer Types

The int type implements the |:library/numbers.txt/numbers.Integral:numbers.Integral| |:glossary.txt/term-abstract-base-class:abstract base
class|. In
addition, it provides a few more methods:

*int.bit_length:int.bit_length()*

   Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding
   the sign and leading zeros:

```rst
>>> n = -37
>>> bin(n)
'-0b100101'
>>> n.bit_length()
6
```

   More precisely, if "x" is nonzero, then "x.bit_length()" is the unique positive
   integer "k" such that "2**(k-1) <= abs(x) < 2**k". Equivalently, when "abs(x)"
   is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then "k = 1 +
   int(log(abs(x), 2))". If "x" is zero, then "x.bit_length()" returns "0".

   Equivalent to:

```rst
def bit_length(self):
    s = bin(self)       # binary representation:  bin(-37) --> '-0b100101'
    s = s.lstrip('-0b') # remove leading zeros and minus sign
    return len(s)       # len('100101') --> 6
```

   New in version 3.1.

*int.to_bytes:int.to_bytes(length, byteorder, *, signed=False)*

   Return an array of bytes representing an integer.

```python
>>> (1024).to_bytes(2, byteorder='big')
b'\x04\x00'
>>> (1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder='big')
b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00'
>>> (-1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder='big', signed=True)
b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfc\x00'
>>> x = 1000
>>> x.to_bytes((x.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='little')
b'\xe8\x03'
```

   The integer is represented using *length* bytes.  An |:library/exceptions.txt/OverflowError:OverflowError| is raised
   if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes.

   The *byteorder* argument determines the byte order used to represent the
   integer.  If *byteorder* is ""big"", the most significant byte is at the
   beginning of the byte array.  If *byteorder* is ""little"", the most significant
   byte is at the end of the byte array.  To request the native byte order of the
   host system, use |:library/sys.txt/sys.byteorder:sys.byteorder| as the byte order value.

   The *signed* argument determines whether two’s complement is used to represent
   the integer.  If *signed* is "False" and a negative integer is given, an
   |:library/exceptions.txt/OverflowError:OverflowError| is raised. The default value for *signed* is "False".

   New in version 3.2.

*int.from_bytes:classmethod int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False)*

   Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes.

```python
>>> int.from_bytes(b'\x00\x10', byteorder='big')
16
>>> int.from_bytes(b'\x00\x10', byteorder='little')
4096
>>> int.from_bytes(b'\xfc\x00', byteorder='big', signed=True)
-1024
>>> int.from_bytes(b'\xfc\x00', byteorder='big', signed=False)
64512
>>> int.from_bytes([255, 0, 0], byteorder='big')
16711680
```

   The argument *bytes* must either be a |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| or an iterable
   producing bytes.

   The *byteorder* argument determines the byte order used to represent the
   integer.  If *byteorder* is ""big"", the most significant byte is at the
   beginning of the byte array.  If *byteorder* is ""little"", the most significant
   byte is at the end of the byte array.  To request the native byte order of the
   host system, use |:library/sys.txt/sys.byteorder:sys.byteorder| as the byte order value.

   The *signed* argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent
   the integer.

   New in version 3.2.

*int.as_integer_ratio:int.as_integer_ratio()*

   Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original integer
   and with a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers)
   is always the integer as the numerator and "1" as the denominator.

   New in version 3.8.

## additional-methods-on-float:Additional Methods on Float

The float type implements the |:library/numbers.txt/numbers.Real:numbers.Real| |:glossary.txt/term-abstract-base-class:abstract base
class|. float also
has the following additional methods.

*float.as_integer_ratio:float.as_integer_ratio()*

   Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float and
   with a positive denominator.  Raises |:library/exceptions.txt/OverflowError:OverflowError| on infinities and a
   |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| on NaNs.

*float.is_integer:float.is_integer()*

   Return "True" if the float instance is finite with integral value, and "False"
   otherwise:

```rst
>>> (-2.0).is_integer()
True
>>> (3.2).is_integer()
False
```

Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings.  Since Python’s
floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a
*decimal* string usually involves a small rounding error.  In contrast,
hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-
point numbers.  This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work.

*float.hex:float.hex()*

   Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string.  For
   finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a leading
   "0x" and a trailing "p" and exponent.

*float.fromhex:classmethod float.fromhex(s)*

   Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string *s*.  The
   string *s* may have leading and trailing whitespace.

Note that |:float.hex:float.hex()| is an instance method, while |:float.fromhex:float.fromhex()| is a
class method.

A hexadecimal string takes the form:

```rst
[sign] ['0x'] integer ['.' fraction] ['p' exponent]
```

where the optional "sign" may by either "+" or "-", "integer" and "fraction" are
strings of hexadecimal digits, and "exponent" is a decimal integer with an
optional leading sign.  Case is not significant, and there must be at least one
hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction.  This syntax is similar
to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to the
syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards.  In particular, the output of |:float.hex:float.hex()| is
usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java code, and
hexadecimal strings produced by C’s "%a" format character or Java’s "
Double.toHexString" are accepted by |:float.fromhex:float.fromhex()|.

Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that
it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the
hexadecimal string "0x3.a7p10" represents the floating-point number "(3 + 10./16
+ 7./16**2) * 2.0**10", or "3740.0":

```rst
>>> float.fromhex('0x3.a7p10')
3740.0
```

Applying the reverse conversion to "3740.0" gives a different hexadecimal string
representing the same number:

```rst
>>> float.hex(3740.0)
'0x1.d380000000000p+11'
```

*|numeric-hash:⚓|* ## hashing-of-numeric-types:Hashing of numeric types

For numbers "x" and "y", possibly of different types, it’s a requirement that "
hash(x) == hash(y)" whenever "x == y" (see the "__hash__()" method documentation
for more details).  For ease of implementation and efficiency across a variety
of numeric types (including |:library/functions.txt/int:int|, |:library/functions.txt/float:float|, |:library/decimal.txt/decimal.Decimal:decimal.Decimal| and
|:library/fractions.txt/fractions.Fraction:fractions.Fraction|) Python’s hash for numeric types is based on a single
mathematical function that’s defined for any rational number, and hence applies
to all instances of |:library/functions.txt/int:int| and |:library/fractions.txt/fractions.Fraction:fractions.Fraction|, and all finite instances of
|:library/functions.txt/float:float| and |:library/decimal.txt/decimal.Decimal:decimal.Decimal|.  Essentially, this function is given by reduction
modulo "P" for a fixed prime "P".  The value of "P" is made available to Python
as the "modulus" attribute of |:library/sys.txt/sys.hash_info:sys.hash_info|.

*CPython implementation detail:* Currently, the prime used is "P = 2**31 - 1" on
machines with 32-bit C longs and "P = 2**61 - 1" on machines with 64-bit C
longs.

Here are the rules in detail:

* If "x = m / n" is a nonnegative rational number and "n" is not divisible by "P",
  define "hash(x)" as "m * invmod(n, P) % P", where "invmod(n, P)" gives the
  inverse of "n" modulo "P".

* If "x = m / n" is a nonnegative rational number and "n" is divisible by "P" (but
  "m" is not) then "n" has no inverse modulo "P" and the rule above doesn’t apply;
  in this case define "hash(x)" to be the constant value "sys.hash_info.inf".

* If "x = m / n" is a negative rational number define "hash(x)" as "-hash(-x)".
  If the resulting hash is "-1", replace it with "-2".

* The particular values "sys.hash_info.inf", "-sys.hash_info.inf" and "
  sys.hash_info.nan" are used as hash values for positive infinity, negative
  infinity, or nans (respectively).  (All hashable nans have the same hash value.)

* For a |:library/functions.txt/complex:complex| number "z", the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are
  combined by computing "hash(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash(z.imag)",
  reduced modulo "2**sys.hash_info.width" so that it lies in "
  range(-2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1), 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1))".  Again, if
  the result is "-1", it’s replaced with "-2".

To clarify the above rules, here’s some example Python code, equivalent to the
built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, |:library/functions.txt/float:float|, or
|:library/functions.txt/complex:complex|:

```rst
import sys, math

def hash_fraction(m, n):
    """Compute the hash of a rational number m / n.

    Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive.
    Equivalent to hash(fractions.Fraction(m, n)).

    """
    P = sys.hash_info.modulus
    # Remove common factors of P.  (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.)
    while m % P == n % P == 0:
        m, n = m // P, n // P

    if n % P == 0:
        hash_value = sys.hash_info.inf
    else:
        # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so
        # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.
        hash_value = (abs(m) % P) * pow(n, P - 2, P) % P
    if m < 0:
        hash_value = -hash_value
    if hash_value == -1:
        hash_value = -2
    return hash_value

def hash_float(x):
    """Compute the hash of a float x."""

    if math.isnan(x):
        return sys.hash_info.nan
    elif math.isinf(x):
        return sys.hash_info.inf if x > 0 else -sys.hash_info.inf
    else:
        return hash_fraction(*x.as_integer_ratio())

def hash_complex(z):
    """Compute the hash of a complex number z."""

    hash_value = hash_float(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash_float(z.imag)
    # do a signed reduction modulo 2**sys.hash_info.width
    M = 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1)
    hash_value = (hash_value & (M - 1)) - (hash_value & M)
    if hash_value == -1:
        hash_value = -2
    return hash_value
```

*|typeiter:⚓|* # iterator-types:Iterator Types*|index-17:⚓|*

Python supports a concept of iteration over containers.  This is implemented
using two distinct methods; these are used to allow user-defined classes to
support iteration.  Sequences, described below in more detail, always support
the iteration methods.

One method needs to be defined for container objects to provide iteration
support:

*container.__iter__:container.__iter__()*

   Return an iterator object.  The object is required to support the iterator
   protocol described below.  If a container supports different types of iteration,
   additional methods can be provided to specifically request iterators for those
   iteration types.  (An example of an object supporting multiple forms of
   iteration would be a tree structure which supports both breadth-first and depth-
   first traversal.)  This method corresponds to the |:c-api/typeobj.txt/c.PyTypeObject.tp_iter:tp_iter| slot of the type
   structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two
methods, which together form the *iterator protocol*:

*iterator.__iter__:iterator.__iter__()*

   Return the iterator object itself.  This is required to allow both containers
   and iterators to be used with the |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/for:for| and |:reference/expressions.txt/in:in| statements. This method
   corresponds to the |:c-api/typeobj.txt/c.PyTypeObject.tp_iter:tp_iter| slot of the type structure for Python objects in
   the Python/C API.

*iterator.__next__:iterator.__next__()*

   Return the next item from the container.  If there are no further items, raise
   the |:library/exceptions.txt/StopIteration:StopIteration| exception.  This method corresponds to the |:c-api/typeobj.txt/c.PyTypeObject.tp_iternext:tp_iternext|
   slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

Python defines several iterator objects to support iteration over general and
specific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more specialized forms.  The
specific types are not important beyond their implementation of the iterator
protocol.

Once an iterator’s |:iterator.__next__:__next__()| method raises |:library/exceptions.txt/StopIteration:StopIteration|, it must continue
to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this property are
deemed broken.

## generator-types:Generator Types

Python’s |:glossary.txt/term-generator:generator|s provide a convenient way to implement the iterator
protocol.  If a container object’s "__iter__()" method is implemented as a
generator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a
generator object) supplying the "__iter__()" and |:reference/expressions.txt/generator.__next__:__next__()| methods. More
information about generators can be found in
|:reference/expressions.txt/yieldexpr:the documentation for
the yield expression|.

*|typesseq:⚓|* # sequence-types-list-tuple-range:Sequence Types — |:list:list|,
|:tuple:tuple|, |:range:range|

There are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects.
Additional sequence types tailored for processing of |:binaryseq:binary data| and
|:textseq:text strings| are described in dedicated sections.

## common-sequence-operations:Common Sequence Operations*|index-18:⚓|*

The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types, both
mutable and immutable. The |:library/collections.abc.txt/collections.abc.Sequence:collections.abc.Sequence| ABC is provided to make it
easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types.

This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority.  In the
table, *s* and *t* are sequences of the same type, *n*, *i*, *j* and *k* are
integers and *x* is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value
restrictions imposed by *s*.

The "in" and "not in" operations have the same priorities as the comparison
operations. The "+" (concatenation) and "*" (repetition) operations have the
same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. [3]

+----------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+

Sequences of the same type also support comparisons.  In particular, tuples and
lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This
means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two
sequences must be of the same type and have the same length.  (For full details
see |:reference/expressions.txt/comparisons:Comparisons| in the language reference.)

Notes:

1. While the "in" and "not in" operations are used only for simple containment
   testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as |:str:str|, |:bytes:bytes|
   and |:bytearray:bytearray|) also use them for subsequence testing:

```rst
>>> "gg" in "eggs"
True
```

2. Values of *n* less than "0" are treated as "0" (which yields an empty sequence
   of the same type as *s*).  Note that items in the sequence *s* are not copied;
   they are referenced multiple times.  This often haunts new Python programmers;
   consider:

```rst
>>> lists = [[]] * 3
>>> lists
[[], [], []]
>>> lists[0].append(3)
>>> lists
[[3], [3], [3]]
```

   What has happened is that "[[]]" is a one-element list containing an empty list,
   so all three elements of "[[]] * 3" are references to this single empty list.
   Modifying any of the elements of "lists" modifies this single list. You can
   create a list of different lists this way:

```rst
>>> lists = [[] for i in range(3)]
>>> lists[0].append(3)
>>> lists[1].append(5)
>>> lists[2].append(7)
>>> lists
[[3], [5], [7]]
```

   Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry
   |:faq/programming.txt/faq-multidimensional-list:How do I create a multidimensional list?|.

3. If *i* or *j* is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence *s*: "
   len(s) + i" or "len(s) + j" is substituted.  But note that "-0" is still "0".

4. The slice of *s* from *i* to *j* is defined as the sequence of items with index
   *k* such that "i <= k < j".  If *i* or *j* is greater than "len(s)", use "len(s)
   ".  If *i* is omitted or "None", use "0".  If *j* is omitted or "None", use "
   len(s)".  If *i* is greater than or equal to *j*, the slice is empty.

5. The slice of *s* from *i* to *j* with step *k* is defined as the sequence of
   items with index  "x = i + n*k" such that "0 <= n < (j-i)/k".  In other words,
   the indices are "i", "i+k", "i+2*k", "i+3*k" and so on, stopping when *j* is
   reached (but never including *j*).  When *k* is positive, *i* and *j* are
   reduced to "len(s)" if they are greater. When *k* is negative, *i* and *j* are
   reduced to "len(s) - 1" if they are greater.  If *i* or *j* are omitted or "None
   ", they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of *k*).  Note, *k*
   cannot be zero. If *k* is "None", it is treated like "1".

6. Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object.  This means
   that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic
   runtime cost in the total sequence length.  To get a linear runtime cost, you
   must switch to one of the alternatives below:

   * if concatenating |:str:str| objects, you can build a list and use |:str.join:str.join()| at the
     end or else write to an |:library/io.txt/io.StringIO:io.StringIO| instance and retrieve its value when
     complete

   * if concatenating |:bytes:bytes| objects, you can similarly use |:bytes.join:bytes.join()| or
     |:library/io.txt/io.BytesIO:io.BytesIO|, or you can do in-place concatenation with a |:bytearray:bytearray| object.
     |:bytearray:bytearray| objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism

   * if concatenating |:tuple:tuple| objects, extend a |:list:list| instead

   * for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation

7. Some sequence types (such as |:range:range|) only support item sequences that follow
   specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence concatenation or repetition.

8. "index" raises |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| when *x* is not found in *s*. Not all
   implementations support passing the additional arguments *i* and *j*. These
   arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the
   extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using "s[i:j].index(x)", only without
   copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the
   sequence rather than the start of the slice.

*|typesseq-immutable:⚓|* ## immutable-sequence-types:Immutable Sequence Types
*|index-20:⚓|*

The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not
also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the |:library/functions.txt/hash:hash()| built-in.

This support allows immutable sequences, such as |:tuple:tuple| instances, to be used
as |:dict:dict| keys and stored in |:set:set| and |:frozenset:frozenset| instances.

Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will
result in |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError|.

*|typesseq-mutable:⚓|* ## mutable-sequence-types:Mutable Sequence Types
*|index-21:⚓|*

The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types. The
|:library/collections.abc.txt/collections.abc.MutableSequence:collections.abc.MutableSequence| ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly
implement these operations on custom sequence types.

In the table *s* is an instance of a mutable sequence type, *t* is any iterable
object and *x* is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions
imposed by *s* (for example, |:bytearray:bytearray| only accepts integers that meet the
value restriction "0 <= x <= 255").

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------+

Notes:

1. *t* must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.

2. The optional argument *i* defaults to "-1", so that by default the last item is
   removed and returned.

3. "remove()" raises |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| when *x* is not found in *s*.

4. The "reverse()" method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when
   reversing a large sequence.  To remind users that it operates by side effect, it
   does not return the reversed sequence.

5. "clear()" and "copy()" are included for consistency with the interfaces of
   mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations (such as |:dict:dict| and
   |:set:set|). "copy()" is not part of the |:library/collections.abc.txt/collections.abc.MutableSequence:collections.abc.MutableSequence| ABC, but
   most concrete mutable sequence classes provide it.

   New in version 3.3: "clear()" and "copy()" methods.

6. The value *n* is an integer, or an object implementing |:reference/datamodel.txt/object.__index__:__index__()|.  Zero and
   negative values of *n* clear the sequence.  Items in the sequence are not
   copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for "s * n" under
   |:typesseq-common:Common Sequence Operations|.

*|typesseq-list:⚓|* ## lists:Lists*|index-23:⚓|*

Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous
items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application).

*list:class list([iterable])*

   Lists may be constructed in several ways:

   * Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: "[]"

   * Using square brackets, separating items with commas: "[a]", "[a, b, c]"

   * Using a list comprehension: "[x for x in iterable]"

   * Using the type constructor: "list()" or "list(iterable)"

   The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as
   *iterable*’s items.  *iterable* may be either a sequence, a container that
   supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If *iterable* is already a list, a
   copy is made and returned, similar to "iterable[:]". For example, "list('abc')"
   returns "['a', 'b', 'c']" and "list( (1, 2, 3) )" returns "[1, 2, 3]". If no
   argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, "[]".

   Many other operations also produce lists, including the |:library/functions.txt/sorted:sorted()| built-in.

   Lists implement all of the |:typesseq-common:common| and |:typesseq-mutable:mutable| sequence operations. Lists
   also provide the following additional method:

   *list.sort:sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)*

      This method sorts the list in place, using only "<" comparisons between items.
      Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire
      sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially
      modified state).

      |:list.sort:sort()| accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (
      |:glossary.txt/keyword-only-parameter:keyword-only arguments|):

      *key* specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison
      key from each list element (for example, "key=str.lower"). The key corresponding
      to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting
      process. The default value of "None" means that list items are sorted directly
      without calculating a separate key value.

      The |:library/functools.txt/functools.cmp_to_key:functools.cmp_to_key()| utility is available to convert a 2.x style *cmp*
      function to a *key* function.

      *reverse* is a boolean value.  If set to "True", then the list elements are
      sorted as if each comparison were reversed.

      This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a
      large sequence.  To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not
      return the sorted sequence (use |:library/functions.txt/sorted:sorted()| to explicitly request a new sorted
      list instance).

      The |:list.sort:sort()| method is guaranteed to be stable.  A sort is stable if it
      guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal —
      this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department,
      then by salary grade).

      For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see |:howto/sorting.txt/sortinghowto:Sorting HOW TO|.

      *CPython implementation detail:* While a list is being sorted, the effect of
      attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined.  The C
      implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and
      raises |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a
      sort.

*|typesseq-tuple:⚓|* ## tuples:Tuples*|index-24:⚓|*

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the |:library/functions.txt/enumerate:enumerate()| built-
in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous
data is needed (such as allowing storage in a |:set:set| or |:dict:dict| instance).

*tuple:class tuple([iterable])*

   Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

   * Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: "()"

   * Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: "a," or "(a,)"

   * Separating items with commas: "a, b, c" or "(a, b, c)"

   * Using the |:tuple:tuple()| built-in: "tuple()" or "tuple(iterable)"

   The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as
   *iterable*’s items.  *iterable* may be either a sequence, a container that
   supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If *iterable* is already a tuple, it
   is returned unchanged. For example, "tuple('abc')" returns "('a', 'b', 'c')" and
   "tuple( [1, 2, 3] )" returns "(1, 2, 3)". If no argument is given, the
   constructor creates a new empty tuple, "()".

   Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The
   parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are
   needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, "f(a, b, c)" is a function
   call with three arguments, while "f((a, b, c))" is a function call with a
   3-tuple as the sole argument.

   Tuples implement all of the |:typesseq-common:common| sequence operations.

For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than
access by index, |:library/collections.txt/collections.namedtuple:collections.namedtuple()| may be a more appropriate choice
than a simple tuple object.

*|typesseq-range:⚓|* ## ranges:Ranges*|index-25:⚓|*

The |:range:range| type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly
used for looping a specific number of times in |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/for:for| loops.

*range:class range(stop)*
class range(start, stop[, step])

   The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in |:library/functions.txt/int:int|
   or any object that implements the "__index__" special method).  If the *step*
   argument is omitted, it defaults to "1". If the *start* argument is omitted, it
   defaults to "0". If *step* is zero, |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| is raised.

   For a positive *step*, the contents of a range "r" are determined by the formula
   "r[i] = start + step*i" where "i >= 0" and "r[i] < stop".

   For a negative *step*, the contents of the range are still determined by the
   formula "r[i] = start + step*i", but the constraints are "i >= 0" and "r[i] >
   stop".

   A range object will be empty if "r[0]" does not meet the value constraint.
   Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from
   the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices.

   Ranges containing absolute values larger than |:library/sys.txt/sys.maxsize:sys.maxsize| are permitted but
   some features (such as |:library/functions.txt/len:len()|) may raise |:library/exceptions.txt/OverflowError:OverflowError|.

   Range examples:

```rst
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> list(range(1, 11))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> list(range(0, 30, 5))
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]
>>> list(range(0, -10, -1))
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
>>> list(range(0))
[]
>>> list(range(1, 0))
[]
```

   Ranges implement all of the |:typesseq-common:common| sequence operations except concatenation
   and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences
   that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually
   violate that pattern).

   *range.start:start*

      The value of the *start* parameter (or "0" if the parameter was not supplied)

   *range.stop:stop*

      The value of the *stop* parameter

   *range.step:step*

      The value of the *step* parameter (or "1" if the parameter was not supplied)

The advantage of the |:range:range| type over a regular |:list:list| or |:tuple:tuple| is that a
|:range:range| object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the
size of the range it represents (as it only stores the "start", "stop" and "step
" values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).

Range objects implement the |:library/collections.abc.txt/collections.abc.Sequence:collections.abc.Sequence| ABC, and provide features
such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support for
negative indices (see |:typesseq:Sequence Types — list, tuple, range|):

```python
>>> r = range(0, 20, 2)
>>> r
range(0, 20, 2)
>>> 11 in r
False
>>> 10 in r
True
>>> r.index(10)
5
>>> r[5]
10
>>> r[:5]
range(0, 10, 2)
>>> r[-1]
18
```

Testing range objects for equality with "==" and "!=" compares them as
sequences.  That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent
the same sequence of values.  (Note that two range objects that compare equal
might have different |:range.start:start|, |:range.stop:stop| and |:range.step:step| attributes, for example "
range(0) == range(2, 1, 3)" or "range(0, 3, 2) == range(0, 4, 2)".)

Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and negative
indices. Test |:library/functions.txt/int:int| objects for membership in constant time instead of iterating
through all items.

Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on
the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object
identity).

New in version 3.3: The |:range.start:start|, |:range.stop:stop| and |:range.step:step| attributes.

See also:

  * The |:code.activestate.com/recipes/579000:linspace recipe|*|linspace-recipe:⚓|*  shows how to implement a lazy
    version of range suitable for floating point applications.

*|index-26:⚓|* *|textseq:⚓|* # text-sequence-type-str:Text Sequence Type — |:str:str|

Textual data in Python is handled with |:str:str| objects, or *strings*. Strings are
immutable |:typesseq:sequences| of Unicode code points.  String literals are written in a
variety of ways:

* Single quotes: "'allows embedded "double" quotes'"

* Double quotes: ""allows embedded 'single' quotes"".

* Triple quoted: "'''Three single quotes'''", """"Three double quotes""""

Triple quoted strings may span multiple lines - all associated whitespace will
be included in the string literal.

String literals that are part of a single expression and have only whitespace
between them will be implicitly converted to a single string literal. That is, "
("spam " "eggs") == "spam eggs"".

See |:reference/lexical_analysis.txt/strings:String and Bytes literals| for more about the various forms of string
literal, including supported escape sequences, and the "r" (“raw”) prefix that
disables most escape sequence processing.

Strings may also be created from other objects using the |:str:str| constructor.

Since there is no separate “character” type, indexing a string produces strings
of length 1. That is, for a non-empty string *s*, "s[0] == s[0:1]".

*|index-27:⚓|*

There is also no mutable string type, but |:str.join:str.join()| or |:library/io.txt/io.StringIO:io.StringIO| can be
used to efficiently construct strings from multiple fragments.

Changed in version 3.3: For backwards compatibility with the Python 2 series,
the "u" prefix is once again permitted on string literals. It has no effect on
the meaning of string literals and cannot be combined with the "r" prefix.

*|index-28:⚓|*

*str:class str(object='')*
class str(object=b'', encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')

   Return a |:textseq:string| version of *object*.  If *object* is not provided, returns the
   empty string.  Otherwise, the behavior of "str()" depends on whether *encoding*
   or *errors* is given, as follows.

   If neither *encoding* nor *errors* is given, "str(object)" returns
   |:reference/datamodel.txt/object.__str__:object.__str__()|, which is the “informal” or nicely printable string
   representation of *object*.  For string objects, this is the string itself.  If
   *object* does not have a |:reference/datamodel.txt/object.__str__:__str__()| method, then |:str:str()| falls back to
   returning |:library/functions.txt/repr:repr(object)|.

   *|index-29:⚓|*

   If at least one of *encoding* or *errors* is given, *object* should be a
   |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| (e.g. |:bytes:bytes| or |:bytearray:bytearray|).  In this case, if *object* is
   a |:bytes:bytes| (or |:bytearray:bytearray|) object, then "str(bytes, encoding, errors)" is
   equivalent to |:bytes.decode:bytes.decode(encoding, errors)|.  Otherwise, the bytes object
   underlying the buffer object is obtained before calling |:bytes.decode:bytes.decode()|.  See
   |:binaryseq:Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview| and |:c-api/buffer.txt/bufferobjects:Buffer Protocol| for
   information on buffer objects.

   Passing a |:bytes:bytes| object to |:str:str()| without the *encoding* or *errors* arguments
   falls under the first case of returning the informal string representation (see
   also the |:using/cmdline.txt/cmdoption-b:-b| command-line option to Python).  For example:

```rst
>>> str(b'Zoot!')
"b'Zoot!'"
```

   For more information on the "str" class and its methods, see
   |:textseq:Text Sequence Type — str| and the |:string-methods:String Methods| section below.  To output
   formatted strings, see the |:reference/lexical_analysis.txt/f-strings:Formatted string literals| and
   |:library/string.txt/formatstrings:Format String Syntax| sections.  In addition, see the
   |:library/text.txt/stringservices:Text Processing Services| section.

*|index-30:⚓|* ## string-methods:String Methods*|index-31:⚓|*

Strings implement all of the |:typesseq-common:common| sequence operations, along with the
additional methods described below.

Strings also support two styles of string formatting, one providing a large
degree of flexibility and customization (see |:str.format:str.format()|,
|:library/string.txt/formatstrings:Format String Syntax| and |:library/string.txt/string-formatting:Custom String Formatting|) and the other based on C
"printf" style formatting that handles a narrower range of types and is slightly
harder to use correctly, but is often faster for the cases it can handle (
|:old-string-formatting:printf-style String Formatting|).

The |:library/text.txt/textservices:Text Processing Services| section of the standard library covers a number
of other modules that provide various text related utilities (including regular
expression support in the |:library/re.txt/module-re:re| module).

*str.capitalize:str.capitalize()*

   Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest
   lowercased.

   Changed in version 3.8: The first character is now put into titlecase rather
   than uppercase. This means that characters like digraphs will only have their
   first letter capitalized, instead of the full character.

*str.casefold:str.casefold()*

   Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for
   caseless matching.

   Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended
   to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase
   letter "'ß'" is equivalent to ""ss"". Since it is already lowercase, |:str.lower:lower()|
   would do nothing to "'ß'"; |:str.casefold:casefold()| converts it to ""ss"".

   The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode Standard.

   New in version 3.3.

*str.center:str.center(width[, fillchar])*

   Return centered in a string of length *width*. Padding is done using the
   specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII space). The original string is
   returned if *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

*str.count:str.count(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring *sub* in the range
   [*start*, *end*].  Optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as in
   slice notation.

*str.encode:str.encode(encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')*

   Return an encoded version of the string as a bytes object. Default encoding is "
   'utf-8'". *errors* may be given to set a different error handling scheme. The
   default for *errors* is "'strict'", meaning that encoding errors raise a
   |:library/exceptions.txt/UnicodeError:UnicodeError|. Other possible values are "'ignore'", "'replace'", "
   'xmlcharrefreplace'", "'backslashreplace'" and any other name registered via
   |:library/codecs.txt/codecs.register_error:codecs.register_error()|, see section |:library/codecs.txt/error-handlers:Error Handlers|. For a list of possible
   encodings, see section |:library/codecs.txt/standard-encodings:Standard Encodings|.

   Changed in version 3.1: Support for keyword arguments added.

*str.endswith:str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])*

   Return "True" if the string ends with the specified *suffix*, otherwise return "
   False".  *suffix* can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for.  With optional *
   start*, test beginning at that position.  With optional *end*, stop comparing at
   that position.

*str.expandtabs:str.expandtabs(tabsize=8)*

   Return a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced by one or more
   spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size.  Tab positions
   occur every *tabsize* characters (default is 8, giving tab positions at columns
   0, 8, 16 and so on).  To expand the string, the current column is set to zero
   and the string is examined character by character.  If the character is a tab ("
   \t"), one or more space characters are inserted in the result until the current
   column is equal to the next tab position. (The tab character itself is not
   copied.)  If the character is a newline ("\n") or return ("\r"), it is copied
   and the current column is reset to zero.  Any other character is copied
   unchanged and the current column is incremented by one regardless of how the
   character is represented when printed.

```python
>>> '01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs()
'01      012     0123    01234'
>>> '01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs(4)
'01  012 0123    01234'
```

*str.find:str.find(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Return the lowest index in the string where substring *sub* is found within the
   slice "s[start:end]".  Optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as
   in slice notation.  Return "-1" if *sub* is not found.

   Note:

     The |:str.find:find()| method should be used only if you need to know the position of *sub
     *.  To check if *sub* is a substring or not, use the |:reference/expressions.txt/in:in| operator:

```rst
>>> 'Py' in 'Python'
True
```

*str.format:str.format(*args, **kwargs)*

   Perform a string formatting operation.  The string on which this method is
   called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces "{}".
   Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a positional
   argument, or the name of a keyword argument.  Returns a copy of the string where
   each replacement field is replaced with the string value of the corresponding
   argument.

```python
>>> "The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}".format(1+2)
'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'
```

   See |:library/string.txt/formatstrings:Format String Syntax| for a description of the various formatting options
   that can be specified in format strings.

   Note:

     When formatting a number (|:library/functions.txt/int:int|, |:library/functions.txt/float:float|, |:library/functions.txt/complex:complex|, |:library/decimal.txt/decimal.Decimal:decimal.Decimal| and
     subclasses) with the "n" type (ex: "'{:n}'.format(1234)"), the function
     temporarily sets the "LC_CTYPE" locale to the "LC_NUMERIC" locale to decode "
     decimal_point" and "thousands_sep" fields of "localeconv()" if they are non-
     ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the "LC_NUMERIC" locale is different than the "
     LC_CTYPE" locale.  This temporary change affects other threads.

   Changed in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the "n" type, the function
   sets temporarily the "LC_CTYPE" locale to the "LC_NUMERIC" locale in some cases.

*str.format_map:str.format_map(mapping)*

   Similar to "str.format(**mapping)", except that "mapping" is used directly and
   not copied to a |:dict:dict|.  This is useful if for example "mapping" is a dict
   subclass:

```python
>>> class Default(dict):
...     def __missing__(self, key):
...         return key
...
>>> '{name} was born in {country}'.format_map(Default(name='Guido'))
'Guido was born in country'
```

   New in version 3.2.

*str.index:str.index(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Like |:str.find:find()|, but raise |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| when the substring is not found.

*str.isalnum:str.isalnum()*

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at
   least one character, "False" otherwise.  A character "c" is alphanumeric if one
   of the following returns "True": "c.isalpha()", "c.isdecimal()", "c.isdigit()",
   or "c.isnumeric()".

*str.isalpha:str.isalpha()*

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at
   least one character, "False" otherwise.  Alphabetic characters are those
   characters defined in the Unicode character database as “Letter”, i.e., those
   with general category property being one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”.
   Note that this is different from the “Alphabetic” property defined in the
   Unicode Standard.

*str.isascii:str.isascii()*

   Return "True" if the string is empty or all characters in the string are ASCII,
   "False" otherwise. ASCII characters have code points in the range U+0000-U+007F.

   New in version 3.7.

*str.isdecimal:str.isdecimal()*

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are decimal characters and there
   is at least one character, "False" otherwise. Decimal characters are those that
   can be used to form numbers in base 10, e.g. U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO.
   Formally a decimal character is a character in the Unicode General Category
   “Nd”.

*str.isdigit:str.isdigit()*

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least
   one character, "False" otherwise.  Digits include decimal characters and digits
   that need special handling, such as the compatibility superscript digits. This
   covers digits which cannot be used to form numbers in base 10, like the
   Kharosthi numbers.  Formally, a digit is a character that has the property value
   Numeric_Type=Digit or Numeric_Type=Decimal.

*str.isidentifier:str.isidentifier()*

   Return "True" if the string is a valid identifier according to the language
   definition, section |:reference/lexical_analysis.txt/identifiers:Identifiers and keywords|.

   Call |:library/keyword.txt/keyword.iskeyword:keyword.iskeyword()| to test whether string "s" is a reserved identifier,
   such as |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/def:def| and |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/class:class|.

   Example:

```rst
>>> from keyword import iskeyword

>>> 'hello'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('hello')
True, False
>>> 'def'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('def')
True, True
```

*str.islower:str.islower()*

   Return "True" if all cased characters [4] in the string are lowercase and there
   is at least one cased character, "False" otherwise.

*str.isnumeric:str.isnumeric()*

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and there
   is at least one character, "False" otherwise. Numeric characters include digit
   characters, and all characters that have the Unicode numeric value property,
   e.g. U+2155, VULGAR FRACTION ONE FIFTH.  Formally, numeric characters are those
   with the property value Numeric_Type=Digit, Numeric_Type=Decimal or
   Numeric_Type=Numeric.

*str.isprintable:str.isprintable()*

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are printable or the string is
   empty, "False" otherwise.  Nonprintable characters are those characters defined
   in the Unicode character database as “Other” or “Separator”, excepting the ASCII
   space (0x20) which is considered printable.  (Note that printable characters in
   this context are those which should not be escaped when |:library/functions.txt/repr:repr()| is invoked on a
   string.  It has no bearing on the handling of strings written to |:library/sys.txt/sys.stdout:sys.stdout| or
   |:library/sys.txt/sys.stderr:sys.stderr|.)

*str.isspace:str.isspace()*

   Return "True" if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there is
   at least one character, "False" otherwise.

   A character is *whitespace* if in the Unicode character database (see
   |:library/unicodedata.txt/module-unicodedata:unicodedata|), either its general category is "Zs" (“Separator, space”), or its
   bidirectional class is one of "WS", "B", or "S".

*str.istitle:str.istitle()*

   Return "True" if the string is a titlecased string and there is at least one
   character, for example uppercase characters may only follow uncased characters
   and lowercase characters only cased ones.  Return "False" otherwise.

*str.isupper:str.isupper()*

   Return "True" if all cased characters [4] in the string are uppercase and there
   is at least one cased character, "False" otherwise.

*str.join:str.join(iterable)*

   Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in *iterable*. A
   |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError| will be raised if there are any non-string values in *iterable*,
   including |:bytes:bytes| objects.  The separator between elements is the string
   providing this method.

*str.ljust:str.ljust(width[, fillchar])*

   Return the string left justified in a string of length *width*. Padding is done
   using the specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII space). The original string
   is returned if *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

*str.lower:str.lower()*

   Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4] converted to
   lowercase.

   The lowercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
   Standard.

*str.lstrip:str.lstrip([chars])*

   Return a copy of the string with leading characters removed.  The *chars*
   argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.  If omitted
   or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to removing whitespace.  The *chars*
   argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:

```rst
>>> '   spacious   '.lstrip()
'spacious   '
>>> 'www.example.com'.lstrip('cmowz.')
'example.com'
```

*str.maketrans:static str.maketrans(x[, y[, z]])*

   This static method returns a translation table usable for |:str.translate:str.translate()|.

   If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode ordinals
   (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to Unicode ordinals, strings (of
   arbitrary lengths) or "None".  Character keys will then be converted to
   ordinals.

   If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the
   resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the character at the
   same position in y.  If there is a third argument, it must be a string, whose
   characters will be mapped to "None" in the result.

*str.partition:str.partition(sep)*

   Split the string at the first occurrence of *sep*, and return a 3-tuple
   containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part
   after the separator.  If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing
   the string itself, followed by two empty strings.

*str.replace:str.replace(old, new[, count])*

   Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring *old* replaced by
   *new*.  If the optional argument *count* is given, only the first *count*
   occurrences are replaced.

*str.rfind:str.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Return the highest index in the string where substring *sub* is found, such that
   *sub* is contained within "s[start:end]".  Optional arguments *start* and *end*
   are interpreted as in slice notation.  Return "-1" on failure.

*str.rindex:str.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Like |:str.rfind:rfind()| but raises |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| when the substring *sub* is not found.

*str.rjust:str.rjust(width[, fillchar])*

   Return the string right justified in a string of length *width*. Padding is done
   using the specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII space). The original string
   is returned if *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

*str.rpartition:str.rpartition(sep)*

   Split the string at the last occurrence of *sep*, and return a 3-tuple
   containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part
   after the separator.  If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing
   two empty strings, followed by the string itself.

*str.rsplit:str.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=- 1)*

   Return a list of the words in the string, using *sep* as the delimiter string.
   If *maxsplit* is given, at most *maxsplit* splits are done, the *rightmost*
   ones.  If *sep* is not specified or "None", any whitespace string is a
   separator.  Except for splitting from the right, |:str.rsplit:rsplit()| behaves like
   |:str.split:split()| which is described in detail below.

*str.rstrip:str.rstrip([chars])*

   Return a copy of the string with trailing characters removed.  The *chars*
   argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.  If omitted
   or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to removing whitespace.  The *chars*
   argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:

```rst
>>> '   spacious   '.rstrip()
'   spacious'
>>> 'mississippi'.rstrip('ipz')
'mississ'
```

*str.split:str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=- 1)*

   Return a list of the words in the string, using *sep* as the delimiter string.
   If *maxsplit* is given, at most *maxsplit* splits are done (thus, the list will
   have at most "maxsplit+1" elements).  If *maxsplit* is not specified or "-1",
   then there is no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).

   If *sep* is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are
   deemed to delimit empty strings (for example, "'1,,2'.split(',')" returns "['1',
   '', '2']").  The *sep* argument may consist of multiple characters (for example,
   "'1<>2<>3'.split('<>')" returns "['1', '2', '3']"). Splitting an empty string
   with a specified separator returns "['']".

   For example:

```rst
>>> '1,2,3'.split(',')
['1', '2', '3']
>>> '1,2,3'.split(',', maxsplit=1)
['1', '2,3']
>>> '1,2,,3,'.split(',')
['1', '2', '', '3', '']
```

   If *sep* is not specified or is "None", a different splitting algorithm is
   applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and
   the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has
   leading or trailing whitespace.  Consequently, splitting an empty string or a
   string consisting of just whitespace with a "None" separator returns "[]".

   For example:

```rst
>>> '1 2 3'.split()
['1', '2', '3']
>>> '1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)
['1', '2 3']
>>> '   1   2   3   '.split()
['1', '2', '3']
```

*|index-32:⚓|*

*str.splitlines:str.splitlines([keepends])*

   Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries.  Line
   breaks are not included in the resulting list unless *keepends* is given and
   true.

   This method splits on the following line boundaries.  In particular, the
   boundaries are a superset of |:glossary.txt/term-universal-newlines:universal newlines|.

   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Representation          | Description                   |
   |=========================|===============================|
   | "\n"                    | Line Feed                     |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\r"                    | Carriage Return               |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\r\n"                  | Carriage Return + Line Feed   |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\v" or "\x0b"          | Line Tabulation               |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\f" or "\x0c"          | Form Feed                     |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x1c"                  | File Separator                |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x1d"                  | Group Separator               |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x1e"                  | Record Separator              |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x85"                  | Next Line (C1 Control Code)   |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\u2028"                | Line Separator                |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\u2029"                | Paragraph Separator           |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+

   Changed in version 3.2: "\v" and "\f" added to list of line boundaries.

   For example:

```rst
>>> 'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines()
['ab c', '', 'de fg', 'kl']
>>> 'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines(keepends=True)
['ab c\n', '\n', 'de fg\r', 'kl\r\n']
```

   Unlike |:str.split:split()| when a delimiter string *sep* is given, this method returns an
   empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in an
   extra line:

```rst
>>> "".splitlines()
[]
>>> "One line\n".splitlines()
['One line']
```

   For comparison, "split('\n')" gives:

```rst
>>> ''.split('\n')
['']
>>> 'Two lines\n'.split('\n')
['Two lines', '']
```

*str.startswith:str.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])*

   Return "True" if string starts with the *prefix*, otherwise return "False". *
   prefix* can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for.  With optional *start*,
   test string beginning at that position.  With optional *end*, stop comparing
   string at that position.

*str.strip:str.strip([chars])*

   Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.
   The *chars* argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.
   If omitted or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to removing whitespace. The
   *chars* argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its
   values are stripped:

```rst
>>> '   spacious   '.strip()
'spacious'
>>> 'www.example.com'.strip('cmowz.')
'example'
```

   The outermost leading and trailing *chars* argument values are stripped from the
   string. Characters are removed from the leading end until reaching a string
   character that is not contained in the set of characters in *chars*. A similar
   action takes place on the trailing end. For example:

```rst
>>> comment_string = '#....... Section 3.2.1 Issue #32 .......'
>>> comment_string.strip('.#! ')
'Section 3.2.1 Issue #32'
```

*str.swapcase:str.swapcase()*

   Return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and
   vice versa. Note that it is not necessarily true that "s.swapcase().swapcase()
   == s".

*str.title:str.title()*

   Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase
   character and the remaining characters are lowercase.

   For example:

```rst
>>> 'Hello world'.title()
'Hello World'
```

   The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups
   of consecutive letters.  The definition works in many contexts but it means that
   apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not
   be the desired result:

```rst
>>> "they're bill's friends from the UK".title()
"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk"
```

   A workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions:

```rst
>>> import re
>>> def titlecase(s):
...     return re.sub(r"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?",
...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0).capitalize(),
...                   s)
...
>>> titlecase("they're bill's friends.")
"They're Bill's Friends."
```

*str.translate:str.translate(table)*

   Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through the
   given translation table.  The table must be an object that implements indexing
   via "__getitem__()", typically a |:glossary.txt/term-mapping:mapping| or |:glossary.txt/term-sequence:sequence|.  When indexed by a
   Unicode ordinal (an integer), the table object can do any of the following:
   return a Unicode ordinal or a string, to map the character to one or more other
   characters; return "None", to delete the character from the return string; or
   raise a |:library/exceptions.txt/LookupError:LookupError| exception, to map the character to itself.

   You can use |:str.maketrans:str.maketrans()| to create a translation map from character-to-
   character mappings in different formats.

   See also the |:library/codecs.txt/module-codecs:codecs| module for a more flexible approach to custom character
   mappings.

*str.upper:str.upper()*

   Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4] converted to
   uppercase.  Note that "s.upper().isupper()" might be "False" if "s" contains
   uncased characters or if the Unicode category of the resulting character(s) is
   not “Lu” (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).

   The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
   Standard.

*str.zfill:str.zfill(width)*

   Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII "'0'" digits to make a string
   of length *width*. A leading sign prefix ("'+'"/"'-'") is handled by inserting
   the padding *after* the sign character rather than before. The original string
   is returned if *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

   For example:

```rst
>>> "42".zfill(5)
'00042'
>>> "-42".zfill(5)
'-0042'
```

*|old-string-formatting:⚓|* ## printf-style-string-formatting:"printf"-style
String Formatting*|index-33:⚓|*

Note:

  The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead
  to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries
  correctly).  Using the newer |:reference/lexical_analysis.txt/f-strings:formatted string literals|, the |:str.format:str.format()|
  interface, or |:library/string.txt/template-strings:template strings| may help avoid these errors.  Each of these
  alternatives provides their own trade-offs and benefits of simplicity,
  flexibility, and/or extensibility.

String objects have one unique built-in operation: the "%" operator (modulo).
This is also known as the string *formatting* or *interpolation* operator. Given
"format % values" (where *format* is a string), "%" conversion specifications in
*format* are replaced with zero or more elements of *values*. The effect is
similar to using the "sprintf()" in the C language.

If *format* requires a single argument, *values* may be a single non-tuple
object. [5]  Otherwise, *values* must be a tuple with exactly the number of
items specified by the format string, or a single mapping object (for example, a
dictionary).

*|index-34:⚓|*

A conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following
components, which must occur in this order:

1. The "'%'" character, which marks the start of the specifier.

2. Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters
   (for example, "(somename)").

3. Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion types.

4. Minimum field width (optional).  If specified as an "'*'" (asterisk), the actual
   width is read from the next element of the tuple in *values*, and the object to
   convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.

5. Precision (optional), given as a "'.'" (dot) followed by the precision.  If
   specified as "'*'" (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next
   element of the tuple in *values*, and the value to convert comes after the
   precision.

6. Length modifier (optional).

7. Conversion type.

When the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the
formats in the string *must* include a parenthesised mapping key into that
dictionary inserted immediately after the "'%'" character. The mapping key
selects the value to be formatted from the mapping.  For example:

```python
>>> print('%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %
...       {'language': "Python", "number": 2})
Python has 002 quote types.
```

In this case no "*" specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a
sequential parameter list).

The conversion flag characters are:

*|index-35:⚓|*

|           | if both are given).                                                   |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "' '"     | (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty   |

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "'+'"     | A sign character ("'+'" or "'-'") will precede the conversion         |
|           | (overrides a “space” flag).                                           |

A length modifier ("h", "l", or "L") may be present, but is ignored as it is not
necessary for Python – so e.g. "%ld" is identical to "%d".

Notes:

1. The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier ("'0o'") to be inserted
   before the first digit.

2. The alternate form causes a leading "'0x'" or "'0X'" (depending on whether the "
   'x'" or "'X'" format was used) to be inserted before the first digit.

3. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if
   no digits follow it.

   The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and
   defaults to 6.

4. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and
   trailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be.

   The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the
   decimal point and defaults to 6.

5. If precision is "N", the output is truncated to "N" characters.

Since Python strings have an explicit length, "%s" conversions do not assume
that "'\0'" is the end of the string.

Changed in version 3.1: "%f" conversions for numbers whose absolute value is
over 1e50 are no longer replaced by "%g" conversions.

*|index-37:⚓|* *|binaryseq:⚓|* # binary-sequence-types-bytes-bytearray-
memoryview:Binary Sequence Types — |:bytes:bytes|, |:bytearray:bytearray|, |:memoryview:memoryview|
*|index-38:⚓|*

The core built-in types for manipulating binary data are |:bytes:bytes| and |:bytearray:bytearray|
. They are supported by |:memoryview:memoryview| which uses the |:c-api/buffer.txt/bufferobjects:buffer protocol| to access
the memory of other binary objects without needing to make a copy.

The |:library/array.txt/module-array:array| module supports efficient storage of basic data types like 32-bit
integers and IEEE754 double-precision floating values.

## bytes-objects:Bytes Objects*|index-39:⚓|*

Bytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes. Since many major binary
protocols are based on the ASCII text encoding, bytes objects offer several
methods that are only valid when working with ASCII compatible data and are
closely related to string objects in a variety of other ways.

*bytes:class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]])*

   Firstly, the syntax for bytes literals is largely the same as that for string
   literals, except that a "b" prefix is added:

   * Single quotes: "b'still allows embedded "double" quotes'"

   * Double quotes: "b"still allows embedded 'single' quotes"".

   * Triple quoted: "b'''3 single quotes'''", "b"""3 double quotes""""

   Only ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the
   declared source code encoding). Any binary values over 127 must be entered into
   bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence.

   As with string literals, bytes literals may also use a "r" prefix to disable
   processing of escape sequences. See |:reference/lexical_analysis.txt/strings:String and Bytes literals| for more about
   the various forms of bytes literal, including supported escape sequences.

   While bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text, bytes objects
   actually behave like immutable sequences of integers, with each value in the
   sequence restricted such that "0 <= x < 256" (attempts to violate this
   restriction will trigger |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError|). This is done deliberately to emphasise
   that while many binary formats include ASCII based elements and can be usefully
   manipulated with some text-oriented algorithms, this is not generally the case
   for arbitrary binary data (blindly applying text processing algorithms to binary
   data formats that are not ASCII compatible will usually lead to data
   corruption).

   In addition to the literal forms, bytes objects can be created in a number of
   other ways:

   * A zero-filled bytes object of a specified length: "bytes(10)"

   * From an iterable of integers: "bytes(range(20))"

   * Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol:  "bytes(obj)"

   Also see the |:library/functions.txt/func-bytes:bytes| built-in.

   Since 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal
   numbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly, the
   bytes type has an additional class method to read data in that format:

   *bytes.fromhex:classmethod fromhex(string)*

      This |:bytes:bytes| class method returns a bytes object, decoding the given string
      object.  The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with ASCII
      whitespace being ignored.

```python
>>> bytes.fromhex('2Ef0 F1f2  ')
b'.\xf0\xf1\xf2'
```

      Changed in version 3.7: |:bytes.fromhex:bytes.fromhex()| now skips all ASCII whitespace in the
      string, not just spaces.

   A reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytes object into its
   hexadecimal representation.

   *bytes.hex:hex([sep[, bytes_per_sep]])*

      Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the
      instance.

```python
>>> b'\xf0\xf1\xf2'.hex()
'f0f1f2'
```

      If you want to make the hex string easier to read, you can specify a single
      character separator *sep* parameter to include in the output. By default between
      each byte.  A second optional *bytes_per_sep* parameter controls the spacing.
      Positive values calculate the separator position from the right, negative values
      from the left.

```python
>>> value = b'\xf0\xf1\xf2'
>>> value.hex('-')
'f0-f1-f2'
>>> value.hex('_', 2)
'f0_f1f2'
>>> b'UUDDLRLRAB'.hex(' ', -4)
'55554444 4c524c52 4142'
```

      New in version 3.5.

      Changed in version 3.8: |:bytes.hex:bytes.hex()| now supports optional *sep* and *
      bytes_per_sep* parameters to insert separators between bytes in the hex output.

Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes
object *b*, "b[0]" will be an integer, while "b[0:1]" will be a bytes object of
length 1.  (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing
will produce a string of length 1)

The representation of bytes objects uses the literal format ("b'...'") since it
is often more useful than e.g. "bytes([46, 46, 46])".  You can always convert a
bytes object into a list of integers using "list(b)".

Note:

  For Python 2.x users: In the Python 2.x series, a variety of implicit
  conversions between 8-bit strings (the closest thing 2.x offers to a built-in
  binary data type) and Unicode strings were permitted. This was a backwards
  compatibility workaround to account for the fact that Python originally only
  supported 8-bit text, and Unicode text was a later addition. In Python 3.x,
  those implicit conversions are gone - conversions between 8-bit binary data and
  Unicode text must be explicit, and bytes and string objects will always compare
  unequal.

*|typebytearray:⚓|* ## bytearray-objects:Bytearray Objects*|index-40:⚓|*

|:bytearray:bytearray| objects are a mutable counterpart to |:bytes:bytes| objects.

*bytearray:class bytearray([source[, encoding[, errors]]])*

   There is no dedicated literal syntax for bytearray objects, instead they are
   always created by calling the constructor:

   * Creating an empty instance: "bytearray()"

   * Creating a zero-filled instance with a given length: "bytearray(10)"

   * From an iterable of integers: "bytearray(range(20))"

   * Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol:  "bytearray(b'Hi!')"

   As bytearray objects are mutable, they support the |:typesseq-mutable:mutable| sequence operations
   in addition to the common bytes and bytearray operations described in
   |:bytes-methods:Bytes and Bytearray Operations|.

   Also see the |:library/functions.txt/func-bytearray:bytearray| built-in.

   Since 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal
   numbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly, the
   bytearray type has an additional class method to read data in that format:

   *bytearray.fromhex:classmethod fromhex(string)*

      This |:bytearray:bytearray| class method returns bytearray object, decoding the given
      string object.  The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with
      ASCII whitespace being ignored.

```python
>>> bytearray.fromhex('2Ef0 F1f2  ')
bytearray(b'.\xf0\xf1\xf2')
```

      Changed in version 3.7: |:bytearray.fromhex:bytearray.fromhex()| now skips all ASCII whitespace in
      the string, not just spaces.

   A reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytearray object into its
   hexadecimal representation.

   *bytearray.hex:hex([sep[, bytes_per_sep]])*

      Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the
      instance.

```python
>>> bytearray(b'\xf0\xf1\xf2').hex()
'f0f1f2'
```

      New in version 3.5.

      Changed in version 3.8: Similar to |:bytes.hex:bytes.hex()|, |:bytearray.hex:bytearray.hex()| now supports
      optional *sep* and *bytes_per_sep* parameters to insert separators between bytes
      in the hex output.

Since bytearray objects are sequences of integers (akin to a list), for a
bytearray object *b*, "b[0]" will be an integer, while "b[0:1]" will be a
bytearray object of length 1.  (This contrasts with text strings, where both
indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1)

The representation of bytearray objects uses the bytes literal format ("
bytearray(b'...')") since it is often more useful than e.g. "bytearray([46, 46,
46])".  You can always convert a bytearray object into a list of integers using
"list(b)".

*|bytes-methods:⚓|* ## bytes-and-bytearray-operations:Bytes and Bytearray
Operations*|index-41:⚓|*

Both bytes and bytearray objects support the |:typesseq-common:common| sequence operations. They
interoperate not just with operands of the same type, but with any
|:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|. Due to this flexibility, they can be freely mixed in
operations without causing errors. However, the return type of the result may
depend on the order of operands.

Note:

  The methods on bytes and bytearray objects don’t accept strings as their
  arguments, just as the methods on strings don’t accept bytes as their arguments.
  For example, you have to write:

```rst
a = "abc"
b = a.replace("a", "f")
```

  and:

```rst
a = b"abc"
b = a.replace(b"a", b"f")
```

Some bytes and bytearray operations assume the use of ASCII compatible binary
formats, and hence should be avoided when working with arbitrary binary data.
These restrictions are covered below.

Note:

  Using these ASCII based operations to manipulate binary data that is not stored
  in an ASCII based format may lead to data corruption.

The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects can be used with arbitrary
binary data.

*bytes.count:bytes.count(sub[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.count:bytearray.count(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence *sub* in the
   range [*start*, *end*].  Optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as
   in slice notation.

   The subsequence to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| or an integer in
   the range 0 to 255.

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
   subsequence.

*bytes.decode:bytes.decode(encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')*
*bytearray.decode:bytearray.decode(encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')*

   Return a string decoded from the given bytes.  Default encoding is "'utf-8'". *
   errors* may be given to set a different error handling scheme.  The default for
   *errors* is "'strict'", meaning that encoding errors raise a |:library/exceptions.txt/UnicodeError:UnicodeError|.
   Other possible values are "'ignore'", "'replace'" and any other name registered
   via |:library/codecs.txt/codecs.register_error:codecs.register_error()|, see section |:library/codecs.txt/error-handlers:Error Handlers|. For a list of
   possible encodings, see section |:library/codecs.txt/standard-encodings:Standard Encodings|.

   Note:

     Passing the *encoding* argument to |:str:str| allows decoding any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|
     directly, without needing to make a temporary bytes or bytearray object.

   Changed in version 3.1: Added support for keyword arguments.

*bytes.endswith:bytes.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.endswith:bytearray.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])*

   Return "True" if the binary data ends with the specified *suffix*, otherwise
   return "False".  *suffix* can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for.  With
   optional *start*, test beginning at that position.  With optional *end*, stop
   comparing at that position.

   The suffix(es) to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

*bytes.find:bytes.find(sub[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.find:bytearray.find(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Return the lowest index in the data where the subsequence *sub* is found, such
   that *sub* is contained in the slice "s[start:end]".  Optional arguments *start*
   and *end* are interpreted as in slice notation.  Return "-1" if *sub* is not
   found.

   The subsequence to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| or an integer in
   the range 0 to 255.

   Note:

     The |:bytes.find:find()| method should be used only if you need to know the position of *sub
     *.  To check if *sub* is a substring or not, use the |:reference/expressions.txt/in:in| operator:

```rst
>>> b'Py' in b'Python'
True
```

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
   subsequence.

*bytes.index:bytes.index(sub[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.index:bytearray.index(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Like |:bytes.find:find()|, but raise |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| when the subsequence is not found.

   The subsequence to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| or an integer in
   the range 0 to 255.

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
   subsequence.

*bytes.join:bytes.join(iterable)*
*bytearray.join:bytearray.join(iterable)*

   Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary data
   sequences in *iterable*.  A |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError| will be raised if there are any values
   in *iterable* that are not |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like
objects|, including |:str:str| objects.  The
   separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object
   providing this method.

*bytes.maketrans:static bytes.maketrans(from, to)*
*bytearray.maketrans:static bytearray.maketrans(from, to)*

   This static method returns a translation table usable for |:bytes.translate:bytes.translate()|
   that will map each character in *from* into the character at the same position
   in *to*; *from* and *to* must both be |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like objects| and have the same
   length.

   New in version 3.1.

*bytes.partition:bytes.partition(sep)*
*bytearray.partition:bytearray.partition(sep)*

   Split the sequence at the first occurrence of *sep*, and return a 3-tuple
   containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its bytearray
   copy, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a
   3-tuple containing a copy of the original sequence, followed by two empty bytes
   or bytearray objects.

   The separator to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

*bytes.replace:bytes.replace(old, new[, count])*
*bytearray.replace:bytearray.replace(old, new[, count])*

   Return a copy of the sequence with all occurrences of subsequence *old* replaced
   by *new*.  If the optional argument *count* is given, only the first *count*
   occurrences are replaced.

   The subsequence to search for and its replacement may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|
   .

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.rfind:bytes.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.rfind:bytearray.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Return the highest index in the sequence where the subsequence *sub* is found,
   such that *sub* is contained within "s[start:end]".  Optional arguments *start*
   and *end* are interpreted as in slice notation. Return "-1" on failure.

   The subsequence to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| or an integer in
   the range 0 to 255.

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
   subsequence.

*bytes.rindex:bytes.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.rindex:bytearray.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])*

   Like |:bytes.rfind:rfind()| but raises |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| when the subsequence *sub* is not found.

   The subsequence to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object| or an integer in
   the range 0 to 255.

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
   subsequence.

*bytes.rpartition:bytes.rpartition(sep)*
*bytearray.rpartition:bytearray.rpartition(sep)*

   Split the sequence at the last occurrence of *sep*, and return a 3-tuple
   containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its bytearray
   copy, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a
   3-tuple containing two empty bytes or bytearray objects, followed by a copy of
   the original sequence.

   The separator to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

*bytes.startswith:bytes.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])*
*bytearray.startswith:bytearray.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])*

   Return "True" if the binary data starts with the specified *prefix*, otherwise
   return "False".  *prefix* can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for.  With
   optional *start*, test beginning at that position.  With optional *end*, stop
   comparing at that position.

   The prefix(es) to search for may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

*bytes.translate:bytes.translate(table, /, delete=b'')*
*bytearray.translate:bytearray.translate(table, /, delete=b'')*

   Return a copy of the bytes or bytearray object where all bytes occurring in the
   optional argument *delete* are removed, and the remaining bytes have been mapped
   through the given translation table, which must be a bytes object of length 256.

   You can use the |:bytes.maketrans:bytes.maketrans()| method to create a translation table.

   Set the *table* argument to "None" for translations that only delete characters:

```rst
>>> b'read this short text'.translate(None, b'aeiou')
b'rd ths shrt txt'
```

   Changed in version 3.6: *delete* is now supported as a keyword argument.

The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects have default behaviours
that assume the use of ASCII compatible binary formats, but can still be used
with arbitrary binary data by passing appropriate arguments. Note that all of
the bytearray methods in this section do *not* operate in place, and instead
produce new objects.

*bytes.center:bytes.center(width[, fillbyte])*
*bytearray.center:bytearray.center(width[, fillbyte])*

   Return a copy of the object centered in a sequence of length *width*. Padding is
   done using the specified *fillbyte* (default is an ASCII space). For |:bytes:bytes|
   objects, the original sequence is returned if *width* is less than or equal to "
   len(s)".

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.ljust:bytes.ljust(width[, fillbyte])*
*bytearray.ljust:bytearray.ljust(width[, fillbyte])*

   Return a copy of the object left justified in a sequence of length *width*.
   Padding is done using the specified *fillbyte* (default is an ASCII space). For
   |:bytes:bytes| objects, the original sequence is returned if *width* is less than or
   equal to "len(s)".

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.lstrip:bytes.lstrip([chars])*
*bytearray.lstrip:bytearray.lstrip([chars])*

   Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading bytes removed.  The *chars*
   argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed -
   the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with ASCII characters.
   If omitted or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to removing ASCII
   whitespace.  The *chars* argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations of
   its values are stripped:

```rst
>>> b'   spacious   '.lstrip()
b'spacious   '
>>> b'www.example.com'.lstrip(b'cmowz.')
b'example.com'
```

   The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.rjust:bytes.rjust(width[, fillbyte])*
*bytearray.rjust:bytearray.rjust(width[, fillbyte])*

   Return a copy of the object right justified in a sequence of length *width*.
   Padding is done using the specified *fillbyte* (default is an ASCII space). For
   |:bytes:bytes| objects, the original sequence is returned if *width* is less than or
   equal to "len(s)".

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.rsplit:bytes.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=- 1)*
*bytearray.rsplit:bytearray.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=- 1)*

   Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using *sep* as the
   delimiter string. If *maxsplit* is given, at most *maxsplit* splits are done,
   the *rightmost* ones.  If *sep* is not specified or "None", any subsequence
   consisting solely of ASCII whitespace is a separator. Except for splitting from
   the right, |:bytearray.rsplit:rsplit()| behaves like |:bytearray.split:split()| which is described in detail below.

*bytes.rstrip:bytes.rstrip([chars])*
*bytearray.rstrip:bytearray.rstrip([chars])*

   Return a copy of the sequence with specified trailing bytes removed.  The *chars
   * argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed
   - the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with ASCII characters.
   If omitted or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to removing ASCII
   whitespace.  The *chars* argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of
   its values are stripped:

```rst
>>> b'   spacious   '.rstrip()
b'   spacious'
>>> b'mississippi'.rstrip(b'ipz')
b'mississ'
```

   The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.split:bytes.split(sep=None, maxsplit=- 1)*
*bytearray.split:bytearray.split(sep=None, maxsplit=- 1)*

   Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using *sep* as the
   delimiter string. If *maxsplit* is given and non-negative, at most *maxsplit*
   splits are done (thus, the list will have at most "maxsplit+1" elements).  If *
   maxsplit* is not specified or is "-1", then there is no limit on the number of
   splits (all possible splits are made).

   If *sep* is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are
   deemed to delimit empty subsequences (for example, "b'1,,2'.split(b',')" returns
   "[b'1', b'', b'2']").  The *sep* argument may consist of a multibyte sequence
   (for example, "b'1<>2<>3'.split(b'<>')" returns "[b'1', b'2', b'3']"). Splitting
   an empty sequence with a specified separator returns "[b'']" or "
   [bytearray(b'')]" depending on the type of object being split.  The *sep*
   argument may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'1,2,3'.split(b',')
[b'1', b'2', b'3']
>>> b'1,2,3'.split(b',', maxsplit=1)
[b'1', b'2,3']
>>> b'1,2,,3,'.split(b',')
[b'1', b'2', b'', b'3', b'']
```

   If *sep* is not specified or is "None", a different splitting algorithm is
   applied: runs of consecutive ASCII whitespace are regarded as a single
   separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if
   the sequence has leading or trailing whitespace.  Consequently, splitting an
   empty sequence or a sequence consisting solely of ASCII whitespace without a
   specified separator returns "[]".

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'1 2 3'.split()
[b'1', b'2', b'3']
>>> b'1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)
[b'1', b'2 3']
>>> b'   1   2   3   '.split()
[b'1', b'2', b'3']
```

*bytes.strip:bytes.strip([chars])*
*bytearray.strip:bytearray.strip([chars])*

   Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading and trailing bytes removed.
   The *chars* argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to
   be removed - the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with ASCII
   characters.  If omitted or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to removing
   ASCII whitespace. The *chars* argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all
   combinations of its values are stripped:

```rst
>>> b'   spacious   '.strip()
b'spacious'
>>> b'www.example.com'.strip(b'cmowz.')
b'example'
```

   The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any |:glossary.txt/term-bytes-like-object:bytes-like object|.

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects assume the use of ASCII
compatible binary formats and should not be applied to arbitrary binary data.
Note that all of the bytearray methods in this section do *not* operate in
place, and instead produce new objects.

*bytes.capitalize:bytes.capitalize()*
*bytearray.capitalize:bytearray.capitalize()*

   Return a copy of the sequence with each byte interpreted as an ASCII character,
   and the first byte capitalized and the rest lowercased. Non-ASCII byte values
   are passed through unchanged.

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.expandtabs:bytes.expandtabs(tabsize=8)*
*bytearray.expandtabs:bytearray.expandtabs(tabsize=8)*

   Return a copy of the sequence where all ASCII tab characters are replaced by one
   or more ASCII spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size.
   Tab positions occur every *tabsize* bytes (default is 8, giving tab positions at
   columns 0, 8, 16 and so on).  To expand the sequence, the current column is set
   to zero and the sequence is examined byte by byte.  If the byte is an ASCII tab
   character ("b'\t'"), one or more space characters are inserted in the result
   until the current column is equal to the next tab position. (The tab character
   itself is not copied.)  If the current byte is an ASCII newline ("b'\n'") or
   carriage return ("b'\r'"), it is copied and the current column is reset to zero.
   Any other byte value is copied unchanged and the current column is incremented
   by one regardless of how the byte value is represented when printed:

```rst
>>> b'01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs()
b'01      012     0123    01234'
>>> b'01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs(4)
b'01  012 0123    01234'
```

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.isalnum:bytes.isalnum()*
*bytearray.isalnum:bytearray.isalnum()*

   Return "True" if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetical ASCII characters or
   ASCII decimal digits and the sequence is not empty, "False" otherwise.
   Alphabetic ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'". ASCII decimal digits
   are those byte values in the sequence "b'0123456789'".

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'ABCabc1'.isalnum()
True
>>> b'ABC abc1'.isalnum()
False
```

*bytes.isalpha:bytes.isalpha()*
*bytearray.isalpha:bytearray.isalpha()*

   Return "True" if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetic ASCII characters and
   the sequence is not empty, "False" otherwise.  Alphabetic ASCII characters are
   those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'ABCabc'.isalpha()
True
>>> b'ABCabc1'.isalpha()
False
```

*bytes.isascii:bytes.isascii()*
*bytearray.isascii:bytearray.isascii()*

   Return "True" if the sequence is empty or all bytes in the sequence are ASCII, "
   False" otherwise. ASCII bytes are in the range 0-0x7F.

   New in version 3.7.

*bytes.isdigit:bytes.isdigit()*
*bytearray.isdigit:bytearray.isdigit()*

   Return "True" if all bytes in the sequence are ASCII decimal digits and the
   sequence is not empty, "False" otherwise. ASCII decimal digits are those byte
   values in the sequence "b'0123456789'".

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'1234'.isdigit()
True
>>> b'1.23'.isdigit()
False
```

*bytes.islower:bytes.islower()*
*bytearray.islower:bytearray.islower()*

   Return "True" if there is at least one lowercase ASCII character in the sequence
   and no uppercase ASCII characters, "False" otherwise.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'hello world'.islower()
True
>>> b'Hello world'.islower()
False
```

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values
   in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

*bytes.isspace:bytes.isspace()*
*bytearray.isspace:bytearray.isspace()*

   Return "True" if all bytes in the sequence are ASCII whitespace and the sequence
   is not empty, "False" otherwise.  ASCII whitespace characters are those byte
   values in the sequence "b' \t\n\r\x0b\f'" (space, tab, newline, carriage return,
   vertical tab, form feed).

*bytes.istitle:bytes.istitle()*
*bytearray.istitle:bytearray.istitle()*

   Return "True" if the sequence is ASCII titlecase and the sequence is not empty,
   "False" otherwise. See |:bytes.title:bytes.title()| for more details on the definition of
   “titlecase”.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'Hello World'.istitle()
True
>>> b'Hello world'.istitle()
False
```

*bytes.isupper:bytes.isupper()*
*bytearray.isupper:bytearray.isupper()*

   Return "True" if there is at least one uppercase alphabetic ASCII character in
   the sequence and no lowercase ASCII characters, "False" otherwise.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'HELLO WORLD'.isupper()
True
>>> b'Hello world'.isupper()
False
```

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values
   in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

*bytes.lower:bytes.lower()*
*bytearray.lower:bytearray.lower()*

   Return a copy of the sequence with all the uppercase ASCII characters converted
   to their corresponding lowercase counterpart.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'Hello World'.lower()
b'hello world'
```

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values
   in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*|index-42:⚓|*

*bytes.splitlines:bytes.splitlines(keepends=False)*
*bytearray.splitlines:bytearray.splitlines(keepends=False)*

   Return a list of the lines in the binary sequence, breaking at ASCII line
   boundaries. This method uses the |:glossary.txt/term-universal-newlines:universal newlines| approach to splitting
   lines. Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless *keepends* is
   given and true.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines()
[b'ab c', b'', b'de fg', b'kl']
>>> b'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines(keepends=True)
[b'ab c\n', b'\n', b'de fg\r', b'kl\r\n']
```

   Unlike |:bytes.split:split()| when a delimiter string *sep* is given, this method returns an
   empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in an
   extra line:

```rst
>>> b"".split(b'\n'), b"Two lines\n".split(b'\n')
([b''], [b'Two lines', b''])
>>> b"".splitlines(), b"One line\n".splitlines()
([], [b'One line'])
```

*bytes.swapcase:bytes.swapcase()*
*bytearray.swapcase:bytearray.swapcase()*

   Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters converted
   to their corresponding uppercase counterpart and vice-versa.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'Hello World'.swapcase()
b'hELLO wORLD'
```

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values
   in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   Unlike |:str.swapcase:str.swapcase()|, it is always the case that "bin.swapcase().swapcase()
   == bin" for the binary versions. Case conversions are symmetrical in ASCII, even
   though that is not generally true for arbitrary Unicode code points.

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.title:bytes.title()*
*bytearray.title:bytearray.title()*

   Return a titlecased version of the binary sequence where words start with an
   uppercase ASCII character and the remaining characters are lowercase. Uncased
   byte values are left unmodified.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'Hello world'.title()
b'Hello World'
```

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values
   in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'". All other byte values are
   uncased.

   The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups
   of consecutive letters.  The definition works in many contexts but it means that
   apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not
   be the desired result:

```rst
>>> b"they're bill's friends from the UK".title()
b"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk"
```

   A workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions:

```rst
>>> import re
>>> def titlecase(s):
...     return re.sub(rb"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?",
...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0)[0:1].upper() +
...                              mo.group(0)[1:].lower(),
...                   s)
...
>>> titlecase(b"they're bill's friends.")
b"They're Bill's Friends."
```

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.upper:bytes.upper()*
*bytearray.upper:bytearray.upper()*

   Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters converted
   to their corresponding uppercase counterpart.

   For example:

```rst
>>> b'Hello World'.upper()
b'HELLO WORLD'
```

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence "
   b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values
   in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*bytes.zfill:bytes.zfill(width)*
*bytearray.zfill:bytearray.zfill(width)*

   Return a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII "b'0'" digits to make a
   sequence of length *width*. A leading sign prefix ("b'+'"/ "b'-'") is handled by
   inserting the padding *after* the sign character rather than before. For |:bytes:bytes|
   objects, the original sequence is returned if *width* is less than or equal to "
   len(seq)".

   For example:

```rst
>>> b"42".zfill(5)
b'00042'
>>> b"-42".zfill(5)
b'-0042'
```

   Note:

     The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
     produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

*|bytes-formatting:⚓|* ## printf-style-bytes-formatting:"printf"-style Bytes
Formatting*|index-43:⚓|*

Note:

  The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead
  to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries
  correctly).  If the value being printed may be a tuple or dictionary, wrap it in
  a tuple.

Bytes objects ("bytes"/"bytearray") have one unique built-in operation: the "%"
operator (modulo). This is also known as the bytes *formatting* or *
interpolation* operator. Given "format % values" (where *format* is a bytes
object), "%" conversion specifications in *format* are replaced with zero or
more elements of *values*. The effect is similar to using the "sprintf()" in the
C language.

If *format* requires a single argument, *values* may be a single non-tuple
object. [5]  Otherwise, *values* must be a tuple with exactly the number of
items specified by the format bytes object, or a single mapping object (for
example, a dictionary).

*|index-44:⚓|*

A conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following
components, which must occur in this order:

1. The "'%'" character, which marks the start of the specifier.

2. Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters
   (for example, "(somename)").

3. Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion types.

4. Minimum field width (optional).  If specified as an "'*'" (asterisk), the actual
   width is read from the next element of the tuple in *values*, and the object to
   convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.

5. Precision (optional), given as a "'.'" (dot) followed by the precision.  If
   specified as "'*'" (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next
   element of the tuple in *values*, and the value to convert comes after the
   precision.

6. Length modifier (optional).

7. Conversion type.

When the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the
formats in the bytes object *must* include a parenthesised mapping key into that
dictionary inserted immediately after the "'%'" character. The mapping key
selects the value to be formatted from the mapping.  For example:

```python
>>> print(b'%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %
...       {b'language': b"Python", b"number": 2})
b'Python has 002 quote types.'
```

In this case no "*" specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a
sequential parameter list).

The conversion flag characters are:

*|index-45:⚓|*

Notes:

1. The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier ("'0o'") to be inserted
   before the first digit.

2. The alternate form causes a leading "'0x'" or "'0X'" (depending on whether the "
   'x'" or "'X'" format was used) to be inserted before the first digit.

3. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if
   no digits follow it.

   The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and
   defaults to 6.

4. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and
   trailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be.

   The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the
   decimal point and defaults to 6.

5. If precision is "N", the output is truncated to "N" characters.

6. "b'%s'" is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series.

7. "b'%r'" is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series.

Note:

  The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in place - it always
  produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

See also:

  *|index-47:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0461:PEP 461| - Adding % formatting to bytes and bytearray

New in version 3.5.

*|typememoryview:⚓|* ## memory-views:Memory Views

|:memoryview:memoryview| objects allow Python code to access the internal data of an object
that supports the |:c-api/buffer.txt/bufferobjects:buffer protocol| without copying.

*memoryview:class memoryview(obj)*

   Create a |:memoryview:memoryview| that references *obj*.  *obj* must support the buffer
   protocol.  Built-in objects that support the buffer protocol include |:bytes:bytes| and
   |:bytearray:bytearray|.

   A |:memoryview:memoryview| has the notion of an *element*, which is the atomic memory unit
   handled by the originating object *obj*.  For many simple types such as |:bytes:bytes|
   and |:bytearray:bytearray|, an element is a single byte, but other types such as
   |:library/array.txt/array.array:array.array| may have bigger elements.

   "len(view)" is equal to the length of |:memoryview.tolist:tolist|. If "view.ndim = 0", the length
   is 1. If "view.ndim = 1", the length is equal to the number of elements in the
   view. For higher dimensions, the length is equal to the length of the nested
   list representation of the view. The |:memoryview.itemsize:itemsize| attribute will give you the
   number of bytes in a single element.

   A |:memoryview:memoryview| supports slicing and indexing to expose its data. One-dimensional
   slicing will result in a subview:

```rst
>>> v = memoryview(b'abcefg')
>>> v[1]
98
>>> v[-1]
103
>>> v[1:4]
<memory at 0x7f3ddc9f4350>
>>> bytes(v[1:4])
b'bce'
```

   If |:memoryview.format:format| is one of the native format specifiers from the |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| module,
   indexing with an integer or a tuple of integers is also supported and returns a
   single *element* with the correct type.  One-dimensional memoryviews can be
   indexed with an integer or a one-integer tuple.  Multi-dimensional memoryviews
   can be indexed with tuples of exactly *ndim* integers where *ndim* is the number
   of dimensions.  Zero-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed with the empty
   tuple.

   Here is an example with a non-byte format:

```rst
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('l', [-11111111, 22222222, -33333333, 44444444])
>>> m = memoryview(a)
>>> m[0]
-11111111
>>> m[-1]
44444444
>>> m[::2].tolist()
[-11111111, -33333333]
```

   If the underlying object is writable, the memoryview supports one-dimensional
   slice assignment. Resizing is not allowed:

```rst
>>> data = bytearray(b'abcefg')
>>> v = memoryview(data)
>>> v.readonly
False
>>> v[0] = ord(b'z')
>>> data
bytearray(b'zbcefg')
>>> v[1:4] = b'123'
>>> data
bytearray(b'z123fg')
>>> v[2:3] = b'spam'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: memoryview assignment: lvalue and rvalue have different structures
>>> v[2:6] = b'spam'
>>> data
bytearray(b'z1spam')
```

   One-dimensional memoryviews of hashable (read-only) types with formats ‘B’, ‘b’
   or ‘c’ are also hashable. The hash is defined as "hash(m) == hash(m.tobytes())":

```rst
>>> v = memoryview(b'abcefg')
>>> hash(v) == hash(b'abcefg')
True
>>> hash(v[2:4]) == hash(b'ce')
True
>>> hash(v[::-2]) == hash(b'abcefg'[::-2])
True
```

   Changed in version 3.3: One-dimensional memoryviews can now be sliced. One-
   dimensional memoryviews with formats ‘B’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ are now hashable.

   Changed in version 3.4: memoryview is now registered automatically with
   |:library/collections.abc.txt/collections.abc.Sequence:collections.abc.Sequence|

   Changed in version 3.5: memoryviews can now be indexed with tuple of integers.

   |:memoryview:memoryview| has several methods:

   *memoryview.__eq__:__eq__(exporter)*

      A memoryview and a *|index-48:⚓|* |:www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118:PEP 3118| exporter are equal if their shapes
      are equivalent and if all corresponding values are equal when the operands’
      respective format codes are interpreted using |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| syntax.

      For the subset of |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| format strings currently supported by |:memoryview.tolist:tolist()|, "v"
      and "w" are equal if "v.tolist() == w.tolist()":

```rst
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('I', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> b = array.array('d', [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
>>> c = array.array('b', [5, 3, 1])
>>> x = memoryview(a)
>>> y = memoryview(b)
>>> x == a == y == b
True
>>> x.tolist() == a.tolist() == y.tolist() == b.tolist()
True
>>> z = y[::-2]
>>> z == c
True
>>> z.tolist() == c.tolist()
True
```

      If either format string is not supported by the |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| module, then the
      objects will always compare as unequal (even if the format strings and buffer
      contents are identical):

```rst
>>> from ctypes import BigEndianStructure, c_long
>>> class BEPoint(BigEndianStructure):
...     _fields_ = [("x", c_long), ("y", c_long)]
...
>>> point = BEPoint(100, 200)
>>> a = memoryview(point)
>>> b = memoryview(point)
>>> a == point
False
>>> a == b
False
```

      Note that, as with floating point numbers, "v is w" does *not* imply "v == w"
      for memoryview objects.

      Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions compared the raw memory disregarding
      the item format and the logical array structure.

   *memoryview.tobytes:tobytes(order=None)*

      Return the data in the buffer as a bytestring.  This is equivalent to calling
      the |:bytes:bytes| constructor on the memoryview.

```rst
>>> m = memoryview(b"abc")
>>> m.tobytes()
b'abc'
>>> bytes(m)
b'abc'
```

      For non-contiguous arrays the result is equal to the flattened list
      representation with all elements converted to bytes. |:memoryview.tobytes:tobytes()| supports all
      format strings, including those that are not in |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| module syntax.

      New in version 3.8: *order* can be {‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’}.  When *order* is ‘C’ or ‘F’,
      the data of the original array is converted to C or Fortran order. For
      contiguous views, ‘A’ returns an exact copy of the physical memory. In
      particular, in-memory Fortran order is preserved. For non-contiguous views, the
      data is converted to C first. *order=None* is the same as *order=’C’*.

   *memoryview.hex:hex([sep[, bytes_per_sep]])*

      Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the
      buffer.

```rst
>>> m = memoryview(b"abc")
>>> m.hex()
'616263'
```

      New in version 3.5.

      Changed in version 3.8: Similar to |:bytes.hex:bytes.hex()|, |:memoryview.hex:memoryview.hex()| now
      supports optional *sep* and *bytes_per_sep* parameters to insert separators
      between bytes in the hex output.

   *memoryview.tolist:tolist()*

      Return the data in the buffer as a list of elements.

```rst
>>> memoryview(b'abc').tolist()
[97, 98, 99]
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('d', [1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
>>> m = memoryview(a)
>>> m.tolist()
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
```

      Changed in version 3.3: |:memoryview.tolist:tolist()| now supports all single character native
      formats in |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| module syntax as well as multi-dimensional representations.

   *memoryview.toreadonly:toreadonly()*

      Return a readonly version of the memoryview object.  The original memoryview
      object is unchanged.

```rst
>>> m = memoryview(bytearray(b'abc'))
>>> mm = m.toreadonly()
>>> mm.tolist()
[89, 98, 99]
>>> mm[0] = 42
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: cannot modify read-only memory
>>> m[0] = 43
>>> mm.tolist()
[43, 98, 99]
```

      New in version 3.8.

   *memoryview.release:release()*

      Release the underlying buffer exposed by the memoryview object.  Many objects
      take special actions when a view is held on them (for example, a |:bytearray:bytearray|
      would temporarily forbid resizing); therefore, calling release() is handy to
      remove these restrictions (and free any dangling resources) as soon as possible.

      After this method has been called, any further operation on the view raises a
      |:library/exceptions.txt/ValueError:ValueError| (except |:memoryview.release:release()| itself which can be called multiple times):

```rst
>>> m = memoryview(b'abc')
>>> m.release()
>>> m[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operation forbidden on released memoryview object
```

      The context management protocol can be used for a similar effect, using the "
      with" statement:

```rst
>>> with memoryview(b'abc') as m:
...     m[0]
...
97
>>> m[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operation forbidden on released memoryview object
```

      New in version 3.2.

   *memoryview.cast:cast(format[, shape])*

      Cast a memoryview to a new format or shape. *shape* defaults to "
      [byte_length//new_itemsize]", which means that the result view will be one-
      dimensional. The return value is a new memoryview, but the buffer itself is not
      copied. Supported casts are 1D -> C-|:glossary.txt/term-contiguous:contiguous| and C-contiguous -> 1D.

      The destination format is restricted to a single element native format in
      |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| syntax. One of the formats must be a byte format (‘B’, ‘b’ or ‘c’). The
      byte length of the result must be the same as the original length.

      Cast 1D/long to 1D/unsigned bytes:

```rst
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('l', [1,2,3])
>>> x = memoryview(a)
>>> x.format
'l'
>>> x.itemsize
8
>>> len(x)
3
>>> x.nbytes
24
>>> y = x.cast('B')
>>> y.format
'B'
>>> y.itemsize
1
>>> len(y)
24
>>> y.nbytes
24
```

      Cast 1D/unsigned bytes to 1D/char:

```rst
>>> b = bytearray(b'zyz')
>>> x = memoryview(b)
>>> x[0] = b'a'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: memoryview: invalid value for format "B"
>>> y = x.cast('c')
>>> y[0] = b'a'
>>> b
bytearray(b'ayz')
```

      Cast 1D/bytes to 3D/ints to 1D/signed char:

```rst
>>> import struct
>>> buf = struct.pack("i"*12, *list(range(12)))
>>> x = memoryview(buf)
>>> y = x.cast('i', shape=[2,2,3])
>>> y.tolist()
[[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], [[6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]]
>>> y.format
'i'
>>> y.itemsize
4
>>> len(y)
2
>>> y.nbytes
48
>>> z = y.cast('b')
>>> z.format
'b'
>>> z.itemsize
1
>>> len(z)
48
>>> z.nbytes
48
```

      Cast 1D/unsigned long to 2D/unsigned long:

```rst
>>> buf = struct.pack("L"*6, *list(range(6)))
>>> x = memoryview(buf)
>>> y = x.cast('L', shape=[2,3])
>>> len(y)
2
>>> y.nbytes
48
>>> y.tolist()
[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
```

      New in version 3.3.

      Changed in version 3.5: The source format is no longer restricted when casting
      to a byte view.

   There are also several readonly attributes available:

   *memoryview.obj:obj*

      The underlying object of the memoryview:

```rst
>>> b  = bytearray(b'xyz')
>>> m = memoryview(b)
>>> m.obj is b
True
```

      New in version 3.3.

   *memoryview.nbytes:nbytes*

      "nbytes == product(shape) * itemsize == len(m.tobytes())". This is the amount of
      space in bytes that the array would use in a contiguous representation. It is
      not necessarily equal to "len(m)":

```rst
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('i', [1,2,3,4,5])
>>> m = memoryview(a)
>>> len(m)
5
>>> m.nbytes
20
>>> y = m[::2]
>>> len(y)
3
>>> y.nbytes
12
>>> len(y.tobytes())
12
```

      Multi-dimensional arrays:

```rst
>>> import struct
>>> buf = struct.pack("d"*12, *[1.5*x for x in range(12)])
>>> x = memoryview(buf)
>>> y = x.cast('d', shape=[3,4])
>>> y.tolist()
[[0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5], [6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5], [12.0, 13.5, 15.0, 16.5]]
>>> len(y)
3
>>> y.nbytes
96
```

      New in version 3.3.

   *memoryview.readonly:readonly*

      A bool indicating whether the memory is read only.

   *memoryview.format:format*

      A string containing the format (in |:library/struct.txt/module-struct:struct| module style) for each element in
      the view. A memoryview can be created from exporters with arbitrary format
      strings, but some methods (e.g. |:memoryview.tolist:tolist()|) are restricted to native single
      element formats.

      Changed in version 3.3: format "'B'" is now handled according to the struct
      module syntax. This means that "memoryview(b'abc')[0] == b'abc'[0] == 97".

   *memoryview.itemsize:itemsize*

      The size in bytes of each element of the memoryview:

```rst
>>> import array, struct
>>> m = memoryview(array.array('H', [32000, 32001, 32002]))
>>> m.itemsize
2
>>> m[0]
32000
>>> struct.calcsize('H') == m.itemsize
True
```

   *memoryview.ndim:ndim*

      An integer indicating how many dimensions of a multi-dimensional array the
      memory represents.

   *memoryview.shape:shape*

      A tuple of integers the length of |:memoryview.ndim:ndim| giving the shape of the memory as an
      N-dimensional array.

      Changed in version 3.3: An empty tuple instead of "None" when ndim = 0.

   *memoryview.strides:strides*

      A tuple of integers the length of |:memoryview.ndim:ndim| giving the size in bytes to access each
      element for each dimension of the array.

      Changed in version 3.3: An empty tuple instead of "None" when ndim = 0.

   *memoryview.suboffsets:suboffsets*

      Used internally for PIL-style arrays. The value is informational only.

   *memoryview.c_contiguous:c_contiguous*

      A bool indicating whether the memory is C-|:glossary.txt/term-contiguous:contiguous|.

      New in version 3.3.

   *memoryview.f_contiguous:f_contiguous*

      A bool indicating whether the memory is Fortran |:glossary.txt/term-contiguous:contiguous|.

      New in version 3.3.

   *memoryview.contiguous:contiguous*

      A bool indicating whether the memory is |:glossary.txt/term-contiguous:contiguous|.

      New in version 3.3.

*|types-set:⚓|* # set-types-set-frozenset:Set Types — |:set:set|, |:frozenset:frozenset|
*|index-49:⚓|*

A *set* object is an unordered collection of distinct |:glossary.txt/term-hashable:hashable| objects. Common
uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and
computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and
symmetric difference. (For other containers see the built-in |:dict:dict|, |:list:list|, and
|:tuple:tuple| classes, and the |:library/collections.txt/module-collections:collections| module.)

Like other collections, sets support "x in set", "len(set)", and "for x in set".
Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or order of
insertion.  Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other
sequence-like behavior.

There are currently two built-in set types, |:set:set| and |:frozenset:frozenset|. The |:set:set|
type is mutable — the contents can be changed using methods like "add()" and "
remove()".  Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as
either a dictionary key or as an element of another set.  The |:frozenset:frozenset| type
is immutable and |:glossary.txt/term-hashable:hashable| — its contents cannot be altered after it is
created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of
another set.

Non-empty sets (not frozensets) can be created by placing a comma-separated list
of elements within braces, for example: "{'jack', 'sjoerd'}", in addition to the
|:set:set| constructor.

The constructors for both classes work the same:

*set:class set([iterable])*
*frozenset:class frozenset([iterable])*

   Return a new set or frozenset object whose elements are taken from *iterable*.
   The elements of a set must be |:glossary.txt/term-hashable:hashable|.  To represent sets of sets, the inner
   sets must be |:frozenset:frozenset| objects.  If *iterable* is not specified, a new empty
   set is returned.

   Sets can be created by several means:

   * Use a comma-separated list of elements within braces: "{'jack', 'sjoerd'}"

   * Use a set comprehension: "{c for c in 'abracadabra' if c not in 'abc'}"

   * Use the type constructor: "set()", "set('foobar')", "set(['a', 'b', 'foo'])"

   Instances of |:set:set| and |:frozenset:frozenset| provide the following operations:

   len(s)

      Return the number of elements in set *s* (cardinality of *s*).

   x in s

      Test *x* for membership in *s*.

   x not in s

      Test *x* for non-membership in *s*.

   *frozenset.isdisjoint:isdisjoint(other)*

      Return "True" if the set has no elements in common with *other*.  Sets are
      disjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set.

   *frozenset.issubset:issubset(other)*
   set <= other

      Test whether every element in the set is in *other*.

   set < other

      Test whether the set is a proper subset of *other*, that is, "set <= other and
      set != other".

   *frozenset.issuperset:issuperset(other)*
   set >= other

      Test whether every element in *other* is in the set.

   set > other

      Test whether the set is a proper superset of *other*, that is, "set >= other and
      set != other".

   *frozenset.union:union(*others)*
   set | other | ...

      Return a new set with elements from the set and all others.

   *frozenset.intersection:intersection(*others)*
   set & other & ...

      Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others.

   *frozenset.difference:difference(*others)*
   set - other - ...

      Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.

   *frozenset.symmetric_difference:symmetric_difference(other)*
   set ^ other

      Return a new set with elements in either the set or *other* but not both.

   *frozenset.copy:copy()*

      Return a shallow copy of the set.

   Note, the non-operator versions of |:frozenset.union:union()|, |:frozenset.intersection:intersection()|, |:frozenset.difference:difference()|,
   and |:frozenset.symmetric_difference:symmetric_difference()|, |:frozenset.issubset:issubset()|, and |:frozenset.issuperset:issuperset()| methods will
   accept any iterable as an argument.  In contrast, their operator based
   counterparts require their arguments to be sets.  This precludes error-prone
   constructions like "set('abc') & 'cbs'" in favor of the more readable "
   set('abc').intersection('cbs')".

   Both |:set:set| and |:frozenset:frozenset| support set to set comparisons. Two sets are equal if
   and only if every element of each set is contained in the other (each is a
   subset of the other). A set is less than another set if and only if the first
   set is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but is not equal). A set
   is greater than another set if and only if the first set is a proper superset of
   the second set (is a superset, but is not equal).

   Instances of |:set:set| are compared to instances of |:frozenset:frozenset| based on their
   members.  For example, "set('abc') == frozenset('abc')" returns "True" and so
   does "set('abc') in set([frozenset('abc')])".

   The subset and equality comparisons do not generalize to a total ordering
   function.  For example, any two nonempty disjoint sets are not equal and are not
   subsets of each other, so *all* of the following return "False": "a<b", "a==b",
   or "a>b".

   Since sets only define partial ordering (subset relationships), the output of
   the |:list.sort:list.sort()| method is undefined for lists of sets.

   Set elements, like dictionary keys, must be |:glossary.txt/term-hashable:hashable|.

   Binary operations that mix |:set:set| instances with |:frozenset:frozenset| return the type of
   the first operand.  For example: "frozenset('ab') | set('bc')" returns an
   instance of |:frozenset:frozenset|.

   The following table lists operations available for |:set:set| that do not apply to
   immutable instances of |:frozenset:frozenset|:

   *frozenset.update:update(*others)*
   set |= other | ...

      Update the set, adding elements from all others.

   *frozenset.intersection_update:intersection_update(*others)*
   set &= other & ...

      Update the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.

   *frozenset.difference_update:difference_update(*others)*
   set -= other | ...

      Update the set, removing elements found in others.

   *frozenset.symmetric_difference_update:symmetric_difference_update(other)*
   set ^= other

      Update the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.

   *frozenset.add:add(elem)*

      Add element *elem* to the set.

   *frozenset.remove:remove(elem)*

      Remove element *elem* from the set.  Raises |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError| if *elem* is not
      contained in the set.

   *frozenset.discard:discard(elem)*

      Remove element *elem* from the set if it is present.

   *frozenset.pop:pop()*

      Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set.  Raises |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError| if the
      set is empty.

   *frozenset.clear:clear()*

      Remove all elements from the set.

   Note, the non-operator versions of the |:frozenset.update:update()|, |:frozenset.intersection_update:intersection_update()|,
   |:frozenset.difference_update:difference_update()|, and |:frozenset.symmetric_difference_update:symmetric_difference_update()| methods will accept
   any iterable as an argument.

   Note, the *elem* argument to the "__contains__()", |:frozenset.remove:remove()|, and |:frozenset.discard:discard()|
   methods may be a set.  To support searching for an equivalent frozenset, a
   temporary one is created from *elem*.

*|typesmapping:⚓|* # mapping-types-dict:Mapping Types — |:dict:dict|*|index-50:⚓|*

A |:glossary.txt/term-mapping:mapping| object maps |:glossary.txt/term-hashable:hashable| values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are
mutable objects.  There is currently only one standard mapping type, the *
dictionary*.  (For other containers see the built-in |:list:list|, |:set:set|, and |:tuple:tuple|
classes, and the |:library/collections.txt/module-collections:collections| module.)

A dictionary’s keys are *almost* arbitrary values.  Values that are not
|:glossary.txt/term-hashable:hashable|, that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other mutable
types (that are compared by value rather than by object identity) may not be
used as keys.  Numeric types used for keys obey the normal rules for numeric
comparison: if two numbers compare equal (such as "1" and "1.0") then they can
be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry.  (Note however, that
since computers store floating-point numbers as approximations it is usually
unwise to use them as dictionary keys.)

Dictionaries can be created by placing a comma-separated list of "key: value"
pairs within braces, for example: "{'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127}" or "{4098:
'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}", or by the |:dict:dict| constructor.

*dict:class dict(**kwarg)*
class dict(mapping, **kwarg)
class dict(iterable, **kwarg)

   Return a new dictionary initialized from an optional positional argument and a
   possibly empty set of keyword arguments.

   Dictionaries can be created by several means:

   * Use a comma-separated list of "key: value" pairs within braces: "{'jack': 4098,
     'sjoerd': 4127}" or "{4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}"

   * Use a dict comprehension: "{}", "{x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}"

   * Use the type constructor: "dict()", "dict([('foo', 100), ('bar', 200)])", "
     dict(foo=100, bar=200)"

   If no positional argument is given, an empty dictionary is created. If a
   positional argument is given and it is a mapping object, a dictionary is created
   with the same key-value pairs as the mapping object.  Otherwise, the positional
   argument must be an |:glossary.txt/term-iterable:iterable| object.  Each item in the iterable must itself be
   an iterable with exactly two objects.  The first object of each item becomes a
   key in the new dictionary, and the second object the corresponding value.  If a
   key occurs more than once, the last value for that key becomes the corresponding
   value in the new dictionary.

   If keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are added
   to the dictionary created from the positional argument.  If a key being added is
   already present, the value from the keyword argument replaces the value from the
   positional argument.

   To illustrate, the following examples all return a dictionary equal to "{"one":
   1, "two": 2, "three": 3}":

```rst
>>> a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
>>> b = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
>>> c = dict(zip(['one', 'two', 'three'], [1, 2, 3]))
>>> d = dict([('two', 2), ('one', 1), ('three', 3)])
>>> e = dict({'three': 3, 'one': 1, 'two': 2})
>>> a == b == c == d == e
True
```

   Providing keyword arguments as in the first example only works for keys that are
   valid Python identifiers.  Otherwise, any valid keys can be used.

   These are the operations that dictionaries support (and therefore, custom
   mapping types should support too):

   list(d)

      Return a list of all the keys used in the dictionary *d*.

   len(d)

      Return the number of items in the dictionary *d*.

   d[key]

      Return the item of *d* with key *key*.  Raises a |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError| if *key* is not in
      the map.

      *|index-51:⚓|*

      If a subclass of dict defines a method "__missing__()" and *key* is not present,
      the "d[key]" operation calls that method with the key *key* as argument.  The "
      d[key]" operation then returns or raises whatever is returned or raised by the "
      __missing__(key)" call. No other operations or methods invoke "__missing__()".
      If "__missing__()" is not defined, |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError| is raised. "__missing__()" must be
      a method; it cannot be an instance variable:

```rst
>>> class Counter(dict):
...     def __missing__(self, key):
...         return 0
>>> c = Counter()
>>> c['red']
0
>>> c['red'] += 1
>>> c['red']
1
```

      The example above shows part of the implementation of |:library/collections.txt/collections.Counter:collections.Counter|.  A
      different "__missing__" method is used by |:library/collections.txt/collections.defaultdict:collections.defaultdict|.

   d[key] = value

      Set "d[key]" to *value*.

   del d[key]

      Remove "d[key]" from *d*.  Raises a |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError| if *key* is not in the map.

   key in d

      Return "True" if *d* has a key *key*, else "False".

   key not in d

      Equivalent to "not key in d".

   iter(d)

      Return an iterator over the keys of the dictionary.  This is a shortcut for "
      iter(d.keys())".

   *dict.clear:clear()*

      Remove all items from the dictionary.

   *dict.copy:copy()*

      Return a shallow copy of the dictionary.

   *dict.fromkeys:classmethod fromkeys(iterable[, value])*

      Create a new dictionary with keys from *iterable* and values set to *value*.

      |:dict.fromkeys:fromkeys()| is a class method that returns a new dictionary. *value* defaults
      to "None".  All of the values refer to just a single instance, so it generally
      doesn’t make sense for *value* to be a mutable object such as an empty list.  To
      get distinct values, use a |:reference/expressions.txt/dict:dict
comprehension| instead.

   *dict.get:get(key[, default])*

      Return the value for *key* if *key* is in the dictionary, else *default*. If *
      default* is not given, it defaults to "None", so that this method never raises a
      |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError|.

   *dict.items:items()*

      Return a new view of the dictionary’s items ("(key, value)" pairs). See the
      |:dict-views:documentation of view objects|.

   *dict.keys:keys()*

      Return a new view of the dictionary’s keys.  See the
      |:dict-views:documentation
of view objects|.

   *dict.pop:pop(key[, default])*

      If *key* is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value, else return *
      default*.  If *default* is not given and *key* is not in the dictionary, a
      |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError| is raised.

   *dict.popitem:popitem()*

      Remove and return a "(key, value)" pair from the dictionary. Pairs are returned
      in LIFO (last-in, first-out) order.

      |:dict.popitem:popitem()| is useful to destructively iterate over a dictionary, as often used
      in set algorithms.  If the dictionary is empty, calling |:dict.popitem:popitem()| raises a
      |:library/exceptions.txt/KeyError:KeyError|.

      Changed in version 3.7: LIFO order is now guaranteed. In prior versions,
      |:dict.popitem:popitem()| would return an arbitrary key/value pair.

   reversed(d)

      Return a reverse iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a shortcut
      for "reversed(d.keys())".

      New in version 3.8.

   *dict.setdefault:setdefault(key[, default])*

      If *key* is in the dictionary, return its value.  If not, insert *key* with a
      value of *default* and return *default*.  *default* defaults to "None".

   *dict.update:update([other])*

      Update the dictionary with the key/value pairs from *other*, overwriting
      existing keys.  Return "None".

      |:dict.update:update()| accepts either another dictionary object or an iterable of key/value
      pairs (as tuples or other iterables of length two).  If keyword arguments are
      specified, the dictionary is then updated with those key/value pairs: "
      d.update(red=1, blue=2)".

   *dict.values:values()*

      Return a new view of the dictionary’s values.  See the
      |:dict-views:documentation of view objects|.

      An equality comparison between one "dict.values()" view and another will always
      return "False". This also applies when comparing "dict.values()" to itself:

```rst
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> d.values() == d.values()
False
```

   Dictionaries compare equal if and only if they have the same "(key, value)"
   pairs (regardless of ordering). Order comparisons (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’, ‘>’) raise
   |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError|.

   Dictionaries preserve insertion order.  Note that updating a key does not affect
   the order.  Keys added after deletion are inserted at the end.

```rst
>>> d = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
>>> d
{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
>>> list(d)
['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
>>> list(d.values())
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> d["one"] = 42
>>> d
{'one': 42, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
>>> del d["two"]
>>> d["two"] = None
>>> d
{'one': 42, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'two': None}
```

   Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.
   This behavior was an implementation detail of CPython from 3.6.

   Dictionaries and dictionary views are reversible.

```rst
>>> d = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
>>> d
{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
>>> list(reversed(d))
['four', 'three', 'two', 'one']
>>> list(reversed(d.values()))
[4, 3, 2, 1]
>>> list(reversed(d.items()))
[('four', 4), ('three', 3), ('two', 2), ('one', 1)]
```

   Changed in version 3.8: Dictionaries are now reversible.

See also:

  |:library/types.txt/types.MappingProxyType:types.MappingProxyType| can be used to create a read-only view of a |:dict:dict|.

## dictionary-view-objects:Dictionary view objects

The objects returned by |:dict.keys:dict.keys()|, |:dict.values:dict.values()| and |:dict.items:dict.items()| are *
view objects*.  They provide a dynamic view on the dictionary’s entries, which
means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes.

Dictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and
support membership tests:

len(dictview)

   Return the number of entries in the dictionary.

iter(dictview)

   Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples of "
   (key, value)") in the dictionary.

   Keys and values are iterated over in insertion order. This allows the creation
   of "(value, key)" pairs using |:library/functions.txt/zip:zip()|: "pairs = zip(d.values(), d.keys())".
   Another way to create the same list is "pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in d.items()]
   ".

   Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may raise a
   |:library/exceptions.txt/RuntimeError:RuntimeError| or fail to iterate over all entries.

   Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.

x in dictview

   Return "True" if *x* is in the underlying dictionary’s keys, values or items (in
   the latter case, *x* should be a "(key, value)" tuple).

reversed(dictview)

   Return a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the dictionary. The
   view will be iterated in reverse order of the insertion.

   Changed in version 3.8: Dictionary views are now reversible.

Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and hashable.  If all
values are hashable, so that "(key, value)" pairs are unique and hashable, then
the items view is also set-like.  (Values views are not treated as set-like
since the entries are generally not unique.)  For set-like views, all of the
operations defined for the abstract base class |:library/collections.abc.txt/collections.abc.Set:collections.abc.Set| are
available (for example, "==", "<", or "^").

An example of dictionary view usage:

```rst
>>> dishes = {'eggs': 2, 'sausage': 1, 'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}
>>> keys = dishes.keys()
>>> values = dishes.values()

>>> # iteration
>>> n = 0
>>> for val in values:
...     n += val
>>> print(n)
504

>>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order)
>>> list(keys)
['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam']
>>> list(values)
[2, 1, 1, 500]

>>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes
>>> del dishes['eggs']
>>> del dishes['sausage']
>>> list(keys)
['bacon', 'spam']

>>> # set operations
>>> keys & {'eggs', 'bacon', 'salad'}
{'bacon'}
>>> keys ^ {'sausage', 'juice'}
{'juice', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'}
```

*|typecontextmanager:⚓|* # context-manager-types:Context Manager Types
*|index-52:⚓|*

Python’s |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/with:with| statement supports the concept of a runtime context defined by a
context manager.  This is implemented using a pair of methods that allow user-
defined classes to define a runtime context that is entered before the statement
body is executed and exited when the statement ends:

*contextmanager.__enter__:contextmanager.__enter__()*

   Enter the runtime context and return either this object or another object
   related to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to
   the identifier in the "as" clause of |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/with:with| statements using this context
   manager.

   An example of a context manager that returns itself is a |:glossary.txt/term-file-object:file object|. File
   objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow |:library/functions.txt/open:open()| to be used as the
   context expression in a |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/with:with| statement.

   An example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one
   returned by |:library/decimal.txt/decimal.localcontext:decimal.localcontext()|. These managers set the active decimal
   context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the copy. This
   allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body of the
   |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/with:with| statement without affecting code outside the "with" statement.

*contextmanager.__exit__:contextmanager.__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)*

   Exit the runtime context and return a Boolean flag indicating if any exception
   that occurred should be suppressed. If an exception occurred while executing the
   body of the |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/with:with| statement, the arguments contain the exception type, value
   and traceback information. Otherwise, all three arguments are "None".

   Returning a true value from this method will cause the |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/with:with| statement to
   suppress the exception and continue execution with the statement immediately
   following the "with" statement. Otherwise the exception continues propagating
   after this method has finished executing. Exceptions that occur during execution
   of this method will replace any exception that occurred in the body of the "with
   " statement.

   The exception passed in should never be reraised explicitly - instead, this
   method should return a false value to indicate that the method completed
   successfully and does not want to suppress the raised exception. This allows
   context management code to easily detect whether or not an |:contextmanager.__exit__:__exit__()| method
   has actually failed.

Python defines several context managers to support easy thread synchronisation,
prompt closure of files or other objects, and simpler manipulation of the active
decimal arithmetic context. The specific types are not treated specially beyond
their implementation of the context management protocol. See the |:library/contextlib.txt/module-contextlib:contextlib|
module for some examples.

Python’s |:glossary.txt/term-generator:generator|s and the |:library/contextlib.txt/contextlib.contextmanager:contextlib.contextmanager| decorator provide a
convenient way to implement these protocols.  If a generator function is
decorated with the |:library/contextlib.txt/contextlib.contextmanager:contextlib.contextmanager| decorator, it will return a
context manager implementing the necessary "__enter__()" and "__exit__()"
methods, rather than the iterator produced by an undecorated generator function.

Note that there is no specific slot for any of these methods in the type
structure for Python objects in the Python/C API. Extension types wanting to
define these methods must provide them as a normal Python accessible method.
Compared to the overhead of setting up the runtime context, the overhead of a
single class dictionary lookup is negligible.

*|typesother:⚓|* # other-built-in-types:Other Built-in Types

The interpreter supports several other kinds of objects. Most of these support
only one or two operations.

## modules:Modules

The only special operation on a module is attribute access: "m.name", where *m*
is a module and *name* accesses a name defined in *m*’s symbol table. Module
attributes can be assigned to.  (Note that the |:reference/simple_stmts.txt/import:import| statement is not,
strictly speaking, an operation on a module object; "import foo" does not
require a module object named *foo* to exist, rather it requires an (external) *
definition* for a module named *foo* somewhere.)

A special attribute of every module is |:object.__dict__:__dict__|. This is the dictionary
containing the module’s symbol table. Modifying this dictionary will actually
change the module’s symbol table, but direct assignment to the |:object.__dict__:__dict__|
attribute is not possible (you can write "m.__dict__['a'] = 1", which defines "
m.a" to be "1", but you can’t write "m.__dict__ = {}").  Modifying |:object.__dict__:__dict__|
directly is not recommended.

Modules built into the interpreter are written like this: "<module 'sys' (built-
in)>".  If loaded from a file, they are written as "<module 'os' from
'/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/os.pyc'>".

*|typesobjects:⚓|* ## classes-and-class-instances:Classes and Class Instances

See |:reference/datamodel.txt/objects:Objects, values and types| and |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/class:Class definitions| for these.

*|typesfunctions:⚓|* ## functions:Functions

Function objects are created by function definitions.  The only operation on a
function object is to call it: "func(argument-list)".

There are really two flavors of function objects: built-in functions and user-
defined functions.  Both support the same operation (to call the function), but
the implementation is different, hence the different object types.

See |:reference/compound_stmts.txt/function:Function definitions| for more information.

*|typesmethods:⚓|* ## methods:Methods*|index-53:⚓|*

Methods are functions that are called using the attribute notation. There are
two flavors: built-in methods (such as "append()" on lists) and class instance
methods.  Built-in methods are described with the types that support them.

If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace) through an
instance, you get a special object: a *bound method* (also called *instance
method*) object. When called, it will add the "self" argument to the argument
list.  Bound methods have two special read-only attributes: "m.__self__" is the
object on which the method operates, and "m.__func__" is the function
implementing the method.  Calling "m(arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n)" is completely
equivalent to calling "m.__func__(m.__self__, arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n)".

Like function objects, bound method objects support getting arbitrary
attributes.  However, since method attributes are actually stored on the
underlying function object ("meth.__func__"), setting method attributes on bound
methods is disallowed.  Attempting to set an attribute on a method results in an
|:library/exceptions.txt/AttributeError:AttributeError| being raised.  In order to set a method attribute, you need to
explicitly set it on the underlying function object:

```rst
>>> class C:
...     def method(self):
...         pass
...
>>> c = C()
>>> c.method.whoami = 'my name is method'  # can't set on the method
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'method' object has no attribute 'whoami'
>>> c.method.__func__.whoami = 'my name is method'
>>> c.method.whoami
'my name is method'
```

See |:reference/datamodel.txt/types:The standard type hierarchy| for more information.

*|index-54:⚓|* *|bltin-code-objects:⚓|* ## code-objects:Code Objects
*|index-55:⚓|*

Code objects are used by the implementation to represent “pseudo-compiled”
executable Python code such as a function body. They differ from function
objects because they don’t contain a reference to their global execution
environment.  Code objects are returned by the built-in |:library/functions.txt/compile:compile()| function and
can be extracted from function objects through their "__code__" attribute. See
also the |:library/code.txt/module-code:code| module.

*|index-56:⚓|*

A code object can be executed or evaluated by passing it (instead of a source
string) to the |:library/functions.txt/exec:exec()| or |:library/functions.txt/eval:eval()|  built-in functions.

See |:reference/datamodel.txt/types:The standard type hierarchy| for more information.

*|bltin-type-objects:⚓|* ## type-objects:Type Objects*|index-57:⚓|*

Type objects represent the various object types.  An object’s type is accessed
by the built-in function |:library/functions.txt/type:type()|.  There are no special operations on types.
The standard module |:library/types.txt/module-types:types| defines names for all standard built-in types.

Types are written like this: "<class 'int'>".

*|bltin-null-object:⚓|* ## the-null-object:The Null Object

This object is returned by functions that don’t explicitly return a value.  It
supports no special operations.  There is exactly one null object, named "None"
(a built-in name).  "type(None)()" produces the same singleton.

It is written as "None".

*|index-58:⚓|* *|bltin-ellipsis-object:⚓|* ## the-ellipsis-object:The Ellipsis
Object

This object is commonly used by slicing (see |:reference/expressions.txt/slicings:Slicings|).  It supports no
special operations.  There is exactly one ellipsis object, named |:library/constants.txt/Ellipsis:Ellipsis| (a
built-in name).  "type(Ellipsis)()" produces the |:library/constants.txt/Ellipsis:Ellipsis| singleton.

It is written as "Ellipsis" or "...".

*|bltin-notimplemented-object:⚓|* ## the-notimplemented-object:The
NotImplemented Object

This object is returned from comparisons and binary operations when they are
asked to operate on types they don’t support. See |:reference/expressions.txt/comparisons:Comparisons| for more
information.  There is exactly one "NotImplemented" object. "
type(NotImplemented)()" produces the singleton instance.

It is written as "NotImplemented".

*|bltin-boolean-values:⚓|* ## boolean-values:Boolean Values

Boolean values are the two constant objects "False" and "True".  They are used
to represent truth values (although other values can also be considered false or
true).  In numeric contexts (for example when used as the argument to an
arithmetic operator), they behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively. The
built-in function |:library/functions.txt/bool:bool()| can be used to convert any value to a Boolean, if the
value can be interpreted as a truth value (see section |:truth:Truth Value Testing|
above).

*|index-59:⚓|*

They are written as "False" and "True", respectively.

*|typesinternal:⚓|* ## internal-objects:Internal Objects

See |:reference/datamodel.txt/types:The standard type hierarchy| for this information.  It describes stack
frame objects, traceback objects, and slice objects.

*|specialattrs:⚓|* # special-attributes:Special Attributes

The implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several object
types, where they are relevant.  Some of these are not reported by the |:library/functions.txt/dir:dir()|
built-in function.

*object.__dict__:object.__dict__*

   A dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object’s (writable)
   attributes.

*instance.__class__:instance.__class__*

   The class to which a class instance belongs.

*class.__bases__:class.__bases__*

   The tuple of base classes of a class object.

*definition.__name__:definition.__name__*

   The name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance.

*definition.__qualname__:definition.__qualname__*

   The |:glossary.txt/term-qualified-name:qualified name| of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator
   instance.

   New in version 3.3.

*class.__mro__:class.__mro__*

   This attribute is a tuple of classes that are considered when looking for base
   classes during method resolution.

*class.mro:class.mro()*

   This method can be overridden by a metaclass to customize the method resolution
   order for its instances.  It is called at class instantiation, and its result is
   stored in |:class.__mro__:__mro__|.

*class.__subclasses__:class.__subclasses__()*

   Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses.  This
   method returns a list of all those references still alive. Example:

```rst
>>> int.__subclasses__()
[<class 'bool'>]
```

-[ Footnotes ]-

[1] Additional information on these special methods may be found in the Python
    Reference Manual (|:reference/datamodel.txt/customization:Basic customization|).

[2] As a consequence, the list "[1, 2]" is considered equal to "[1.0, 2.0]", and
    similarly for tuples.

[3] They must have since the parser can’t tell the type of the operands.

[4] Cased characters are those with general category property being one of “Lu”
    (Letter, uppercase), “Ll” (Letter, lowercase), or “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).

[5] To format only a tuple you should therefore provide a singleton tuple whose only
    element is the tuple to be formatted.
