The modules described in this chapter allow writing interfaces similar to
Python’s interactive interpreter.  If you want a Python interpreter that
supports some special feature in addition to the Python language, you should
look at the |:library/code.txt/module-code:code| module.  (The |:library/codeop.txt/module-codeop:codeop| module is lower-level, used to support
compiling a possibly-incomplete chunk of Python code.)

The full list of modules described in this chapter is:

* |:library/code.txt:code — Interpreter base classes|

  * |:library/code.txt/interactive-interpreter-objects:Interactive Interpreter Objects|

  * |:library/code.txt/interactive-console-objects:Interactive Console Objects|

* |:library/codeop.txt:codeop — Compile Python code|
