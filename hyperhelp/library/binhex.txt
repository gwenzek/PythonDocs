*|module-binhex:⚓|*

*Source code:* |:github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib/binhex.py:Lib/binhex.py|

======================================================================

This module encodes and decodes files in binhex4 format, a format allowing
representation of Macintosh files in ASCII. Only the data fork is handled.

The |:module-binhex:binhex| module defines the following functions:

*binhex.binhex:binhex.binhex(input, output)*

   Convert a binary file with filename *input* to binhex file *output*. The *output
   * parameter can either be a filename or a file-like object (any object
   supporting a "write()" and "close()" method).

*binhex.hexbin:binhex.hexbin(input, output)*

   Decode a binhex file *input*. *input* may be a filename or a file-like object
   supporting "read()" and "close()" methods. The resulting file is written to a
   file named *output*, unless the argument is "None" in which case the output
   filename is read from the binhex file.

The following exception is also defined:

*binhex.Error:exception binhex.Error*

   Exception raised when something can’t be encoded using the binhex format (for
   example, a filename is too long to fit in the filename field), or when input is
   not properly encoded binhex data.

  Module |:library/binascii.txt/module-binascii:binascii|
     Support module containing ASCII-to-binary and binary-to-ASCII conversions.

# notes:Notes

There is an alternative, more powerful interface to the coder and decoder, see
the source for details.

If you code or decode textfiles on non-Macintosh platforms they will still use
the old Macintosh newline convention (carriage-return as end of line).
