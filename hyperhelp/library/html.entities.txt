*Source code:* |:github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib/html/entities.py:Lib/html/entities.py|

======================================================================

This module defines four dictionaries, |:html.entities.html5:html5|, |:html.entities.name2codepoint:name2codepoint|,
|:html.entities.codepoint2name:codepoint2name|, and |:html.entities.entitydefs:entitydefs|.

*html.entities.html5:html.entities.html5*

   A dictionary that maps HTML5 named character references [1] to the equivalent
   Unicode character(s), e.g. "html5['gt;'] == '>'". Note that the trailing
   semicolon is included in the name (e.g. "'gt;'"), however some of the names are
   accepted by the standard even without the semicolon: in this case the name is
   present with and without the "';'". See also |:library/html.txt/html.unescape:html.unescape()|.

   New in version 3.3.

*html.entities.entitydefs:html.entities.entitydefs*

   A dictionary mapping XHTML 1.0 entity definitions to their replacement text in
   ISO Latin-1.

*html.entities.name2codepoint:html.entities.name2codepoint*

   A dictionary that maps HTML entity names to the Unicode code points.

*html.entities.codepoint2name:html.entities.codepoint2name*

   A dictionary that maps Unicode code points to HTML entity names.
