======================================================================

This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as
defined in *|index-1:⚓|* |:tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1521.html:RFC 1521|: “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of
Internet Message Bodies”. The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data
where there are relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding
scheme available via the |:library/base64.txt/module-base64:base64| module is more compact if there are many such
characters, as when sending a graphics file.

*quopri.decode:quopri.decode(input, output, header=False)*

   Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded binary
   data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be |:glossary.txt/term-file-object:binary file objects|.
   If the optional argument *header* is present and true, underscore will be
   decoded as space. This is used to decode “Q”-encoded headers as described in
   *|index-2:⚓|* |:tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1522.html:RFC 1522|: “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part
   Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text”.

*quopri.encode:quopri.encode(input, output, quotetabs, header=False)*

   Encode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting quoted-printable
   data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be |:glossary.txt/term-file-object:binary file objects|. *
   quotetabs*, a non-optional flag which controls whether to encode embedded spaces
   and tabs; when true it encodes such embedded whitespace, and when false it
   leaves them unencoded. Note that spaces and tabs appearing at the end of lines
   are always encoded, as per *|index-3:⚓|* |:tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1521.html:RFC 1521|.  *header* is a flag which
   controls if spaces are encoded as underscores as per *|index-4:⚓|* |:tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1522.html:RFC 1522|.

*quopri.decodestring:quopri.decodestring(s, header=False)*

   Like |:quopri.decode:decode()|, except that it accepts a source |:library/stdtypes.txt/bytes:bytes| and returns the
   corresponding decoded |:library/stdtypes.txt/bytes:bytes|.

*quopri.encodestring:quopri.encodestring(s, quotetabs=False, header=False)*

   Like |:quopri.encode:encode()|, except that it accepts a source |:library/stdtypes.txt/bytes:bytes| and returns the
   corresponding encoded |:library/stdtypes.txt/bytes:bytes|. By default, it sends a "False" value to *
   quotetabs* parameter of the |:quopri.encode:encode()| function.
