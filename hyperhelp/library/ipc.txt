The modules described in this chapter provide mechanisms for networking and
inter-processes communication.

Some modules only work for two processes that are on the same machine, e.g.
|:library/signal.txt/module-signal:signal| and |:library/mmap.txt/module-mmap:mmap|.  Other modules support networking protocols that two or
more processes can use to communicate across machines.

The list of modules described in this chapter is:

* |:library/asyncio.txt:asyncio — Asynchronous I/O|

* |:library/socket.txt:socket — Low-level networking interface|

* |:library/ssl.txt:ssl — TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects|

* |:library/select.txt:select — Waiting for I/O completion|

* |:library/selectors.txt:selectors — High-level I/O multiplexing|

* |:library/asyncore.txt:asyncore — Asynchronous socket handler|

* |:library/asynchat.txt:asynchat — Asynchronous socket command/response handler|

* |:library/signal.txt:signal — Set handlers for asynchronous events|

* |:library/mmap.txt:mmap — Memory-mapped file support|
