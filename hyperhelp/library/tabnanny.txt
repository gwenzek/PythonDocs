*Source code:* |:github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib/tabnanny.py:Lib/tabnanny.py|

======================================================================

For the time being this module is intended to be called as a script. However it
is possible to import it into an IDE and use the function |:tabnanny.check:check()| described
below.

Note:

  The API provided by this module is likely to change in future releases; such
  changes may not be backward compatible.

*tabnanny.check:tabnanny.check(file_or_dir)*

   If *file_or_dir* is a directory and not a symbolic link, then recursively
   descend the directory tree named by *file_or_dir*, checking all ".py" files
   along the way.  If *file_or_dir* is an ordinary Python source file, it is
   checked for whitespace related problems.  The diagnostic messages are written to
   standard output using the |:library/functions.txt/print:print()| function.

*tabnanny.verbose:tabnanny.verbose*

   Flag indicating whether to print verbose messages. This is incremented by the "
   -v" option if called as a script.

*tabnanny.filename_only:tabnanny.filename_only*

   Flag indicating whether to print only the filenames of files containing
   whitespace related problems.  This is set to true by the "-q" option if called
   as a script.

*tabnanny.NannyNag:exception tabnanny.NannyNag*

   Raised by |:tabnanny.process_tokens:process_tokens()| if detecting an ambiguous indent. Captured and
   handled in |:tabnanny.check:check()|.

*tabnanny.process_tokens:tabnanny.process_tokens(tokens)*

   This function is used by |:tabnanny.check:check()| to process tokens generated by the |:library/tokenize.txt/module-tokenize:tokenize|
   module.
