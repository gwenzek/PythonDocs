*|undocumented-modules:⚓|*

Here’s a quick listing of modules that are currently undocumented, but that
should be documented.  Feel free to contribute documentation for them!  (Send
via email to docs@python.org.)

The idea and original contents for this chapter were taken from a posting by
Fredrik Lundh; the specific contents of this chapter have been substantially
revised.

# platform-specific-modules:Platform specific modules

These modules are used to implement the |:library/os.path.txt/module-os.path:os.path| module, and are not documented
beyond this mention.  There’s little need to document these.

"ntpath"
   — Implementation of |:library/os.path.txt/module-os.path:os.path| on Win32 and Win64 platforms.

"posixpath"
   — Implementation of |:library/os.path.txt/module-os.path:os.path| on POSIX.
