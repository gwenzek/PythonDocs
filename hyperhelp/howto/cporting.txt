*|porting-extension-modules-to-python-3:⚓|*

We recommend the following resources for porting extension modules to Python 3:

* The |:python3porting.com/cextensions.html:Migrating C extensions| chapter from *Supporting Python 3: An in-depth
  guide*, a book on moving from Python 2 to Python 3 in general, guides the reader
  through porting an extension module.

* The |:py3c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html:Porting guide| from the *py3c* project provides opinionated suggestions
  with supporting code.

* The |:cython.org:Cython| and |:cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest:CFFI| libraries offer abstractions over Python’s C API.
  Extensions generally need to be re-written to use one of them, but the library
  then handles differences between various Python versions and implementations.
