*|about-these-documents:⚓|*

These documents are generated from |:docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html:reStructuredText| sources by |:sphinx-doc.org:Sphinx|, a
document processor specifically written for the Python documentation.

*|restructuredtext:⚓|* *|sphinx:⚓|*

Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer
effort, just like Python itself.  If you want to contribute, please take a look
at the |:bugs.txt/reporting-bugs:Dealing with Bugs| page for information on how to do so.  New volunteers
are always welcome!

Many thanks go to:

* Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset and
  writer of much of the content;

* the |:docutils.sourceforge.net:Docutils|*|docutils:⚓|*  project for creating reStructuredText and the
  Docutils suite;

* Fredrik Lundh for his |:effbot.org/zone/pyref.htm:Alternative Python Reference|*|alternative-python-
  reference:⚓|*  project from which Sphinx got many good ideas.

It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community that Python
has such wonderful documentation – Thank You!
