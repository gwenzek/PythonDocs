Booleans in Python are implemented as a subclass of integers.  There are only
two booleans, "Py_False" and "Py_True".  As such, the normal creation and
deletion functions don’t apply to booleans.  The following macros are available,
however.

*c.PyBool_Check:int PyBool_Check(PyObject *o)
*

   Return true if *o* is of type "PyBool_Type".

*c.Py_False:|:c-api/structures.txt/c.PyObject:PyObject| *Py_False
*

   The Python "False" object.  This object has no methods.  It needs to be treated
   just like any other object with respect to reference counts.

*c.Py_True:|:c-api/structures.txt/c.PyObject:PyObject| *Py_True
*

   The Python "True" object.  This object has no methods.  It needs to be treated
   just like any other object with respect to reference counts.

*c.Py_RETURN_FALSE:Py_RETURN_FALSE
*

   Return "Py_False" from a function, properly incrementing its reference count.

*c.Py_RETURN_TRUE:Py_RETURN_TRUE
*

   Return "Py_True" from a function, properly incrementing its reference count.

*c.PyBool_FromLong:|:c-api/structures.txt/c.PyObject:PyObject| *PyBool_FromLong(long v)
*
    *Return value: New reference.*

   Return a new reference to "Py_True" or "Py_False" depending on the truth value
   of *v*.
