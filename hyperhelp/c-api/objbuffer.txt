*|old-buffer-protocol:⚓|*

Deprecated since version 3.0.

These functions were part of the “old buffer protocol” API in Python 2. In
Python 3, this protocol doesn’t exist anymore but the functions are still
exposed to ease porting 2.x code.  They act as a compatibility wrapper around
the |:c-api/buffer.txt/bufferobjects:new buffer protocol|, but they don’t give you control over the lifetime of
the resources acquired when a buffer is exported.

Therefore, it is recommended that you call |:c-api/buffer.txt/c.PyObject_GetBuffer:PyObject_GetBuffer()| (or the "y*"
or "w*" |:c-api/arg.txt/arg-parsing:format codes| with the |:c-api/arg.txt/c.PyArg_ParseTuple:PyArg_ParseTuple()| family of functions) to get
a buffer view over an object, and |:c-api/buffer.txt/c.PyBuffer_Release:PyBuffer_Release()| when the buffer view can
be released.

*c.PyObject_AsCharBuffer:int PyObject_AsCharBuffer(PyObject *obj, const char **buffer, Py_ssize_t *buffer_len)
*

   Returns a pointer to a read-only memory location usable as character-based
   input.  The *obj* argument must support the single-segment character buffer
   interface.  On success, returns "0", sets *buffer* to the memory location and *
   buffer_len* to the buffer length.  Returns "-1" and sets a |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError| on error.

*c.PyObject_AsReadBuffer:int PyObject_AsReadBuffer(PyObject *obj, const void **buffer, Py_ssize_t *buffer_len)
*

   Returns a pointer to a read-only memory location containing arbitrary data. The
   *obj* argument must support the single-segment readable buffer interface.  On
   success, returns "0", sets *buffer* to the memory location and *buffer_len* to
   the buffer length.  Returns "-1" and sets a |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError| on error.

*c.PyObject_CheckReadBuffer:int PyObject_CheckReadBuffer(PyObject *o)
*

   Returns "1" if *o* supports the single-segment readable buffer interface.
   Otherwise returns "0".  This function always succeeds.

   Note that this function tries to get and release a buffer, and exceptions which
   occur while calling corresponding functions will get suppressed. To get error
   reporting use |:c-api/buffer.txt/c.PyObject_GetBuffer:PyObject_GetBuffer()| instead.

*c.PyObject_AsWriteBuffer:int PyObject_AsWriteBuffer(PyObject *obj, void **buffer, Py_ssize_t *buffer_len)
*

   Returns a pointer to a writable memory location.  The *obj* argument must
   support the single-segment, character buffer interface.  On success, returns "0"
   , sets *buffer* to the memory location and *buffer_len* to the buffer length.
   Returns "-1" and sets a |:library/exceptions.txt/TypeError:TypeError| on error.
