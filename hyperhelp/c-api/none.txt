Note that the |:c-api/type.txt/c.PyTypeObject:PyTypeObject| for "None" is not directly exposed in the Python/C
API.  Since "None" is a singleton, testing for object identity (using "==" in C)
is sufficient. There is no "PyNone_Check()" function for the same reason.

*c.Py_None:|:c-api/structures.txt/c.PyObject:PyObject| *Py_None
*

   The Python "None" object, denoting lack of value.  This object has no methods.
   It needs to be treated just like any other object with respect to reference
   counts.

*c.Py_RETURN_NONE:Py_RETURN_NONE
*

   Properly handle returning |:c.Py_None:Py_None| from within a C function (that is, increment
   the reference count of "None" and return it.)
